This will permit the recovery of wound inflicted during recovery.\n  _For example: While recovering from a medium wound, Thibault fell badly in the stairs while trying to reach the latrines. Opening the sanatorium will allow the recovery of the new wound on the same season_\n\n- The current wounds are displayed by increased gravity. A green aura means that the wound will improve at the end of the recovery period and a red aura indicates that it will get worse.\n- If there is not enough days to do a recovery roll for this season or if the wound is fully healed, the wound icon will get a small lock icon on the top right corner.\n- Hovering with the mouse on a wound will show the modifier to the next roll.\n- For wounds inflicted mid-season, it is possible to adjust the number of days remaining before the first recovery roll.\n- Button \"Roll for recovery\" : click until there is no more days available or wounds to recover from\n- Button \"End of season\" : Clickable only when it is not possible to roll anymore. It will create a new diary entry in the patient calendar containing the medical log for the season.\n\n### Patient's file\n\n- A log of all the rolls made for the season is created. It shows for each wound whether a roll has succeeded or failed and the wound penalty at the end of the period.\n  Note: The RAW states that if more than a month is spent at a given wound penalty it can impact the seasonal activities for the season:\n- -6 or greater : no other activity possible\n- -3 to -5 : No lab activity or crafting possible\n- -1 to -2 : No spells that cost fatigue (important if you intent to cast spontaneous CrCo spells for further recovery)\n- Dev note: Unfortunately, between wound getting worse and better during a season and multiple recovery activities the same season, it has become too complex to compute reliably if the penalty lasted a month during the season (not that it is impossible to do, but it is simpler to do the math... for now)\n\n### Medical history\n\nAll healed wounds are kept in the medical history next to the bandaged hand in the Vitals&Combat tab. You can clear it all using the Perdo hand gesture on the top-right.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/MedicalHistory.webp)",

That way you can name it as you wish and in the language you prefer (the **system** doesn't care about what you name it, as long as the Ability Key is kept). The option field is read-only most of the time, but it is used for generic abilities (eg: Area Lore, Crafting , Languages,... ) to distinguish between them.

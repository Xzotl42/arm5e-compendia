    "biography": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Equipment:</strong> Anything he wants, although particularly elaborate items gained particularly quickly will be faerie glamor rather than real.<br><strong>Vis:</strong> 10 Aquam, in his blood.<br><strong>Appearance:</strong> Tall, well-built, and handsome, with white skin, pale blond hair, and eyes the clear gray of sea ice. He wears fine clothes in white and blue, and a crown of diamonds rests on his brow. He almost looks like a human being, but the authority in his voice belies that, as does the fact that literal ice water runs in his veins; when he bleeds, there are small crystals of ice in the water that flows out.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Lord Marsyne is the ruler of a faerie domain in the far north or in a range of high mountains. His home is a castle of fantastic beauty, made entirely of ice, and he has an extensive faerie retinue. Marsyne and his faeries act out an elaborate charade of the routines and festivals of mundane noble life, hunting strange creatures, holding tournaments, and even passing judgment on criminals within the court.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Most of the time, the court has little direct contact with humans. However, Lord Marsyne always has a human wife, and every so often he needs to find a new one. He always chooses a beautiful, young woman, and looks for some spark of creativity, independence, and spirit. He is quite taken by The Gift, and any beautiful, young Gifted woman in the area he is searching is very likely to be wooed. The wooing is utterly sincere, as the wife must return of her own free will.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Marsyne's wife plays an important role in the politics of the court, having her own set of faerie ladies-in-waiting and servants, and presiding over many of the tournaments. She also plays an important mystical role, as her presence and creativity allow the faeries to do new things. One thing she is not, is a physical wife to Lord Marsyne.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">As long as the wife follows the rules of the court, everything is fine. Marsyne makes her unaging, and protects her from the cold. If she breaks the rules, however, Marsyne judges her, entombs her in ice, and seeks out a new wife. He has many entombed wives, as some of the rules are along the lines of the classic \"Do not go into this room. Here is the key.\"</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">It is also possible for a wife to win her freedom, either through a successful challenge by an external champion, or through her own wits. Lord Marsyne remains fond of any wife who wins her freedom fairly, because that is part of the rules, but any who simply flee are brought back and entombed in the ice.</p></div>",

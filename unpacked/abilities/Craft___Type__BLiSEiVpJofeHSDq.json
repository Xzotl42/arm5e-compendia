In general, Craft Abilities are distinguished by the material they work with, although you may also take a Craft Ability that allows the character to work with several materials in one specific way. You may purchase Craft more than once, choosing a different one each time. Skill in one Craft does not imply skill in any others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> as appropriate to the craft.</p>",

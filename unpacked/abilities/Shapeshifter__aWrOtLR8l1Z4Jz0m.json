This requires a few seconds' (one round's) concentration, and a roll of Stamina + Shapeshift against an Ease Factor of 9. Changing back to human form requires the same concentration, and the same roll.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You have a limited repertoire of shapes, one for every point you have in the Shapeshift ability. Every time you raise the Ability by one point, you may choose a new shape.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> One of your shapes, particular conditions for the change.

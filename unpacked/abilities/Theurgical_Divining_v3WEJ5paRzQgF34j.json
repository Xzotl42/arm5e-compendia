    "description": "<p>The elementalist can sense beings with Might associated with the appropriate element in the general region. He can tell the approximate distance and direction to the target, and he can mentally communicate with it by touching it or the container in which it is held. If the being is intelligent, the two of them can converse for as long as the elementalist maintains concentration. If it is not intelligent, the elementalist can perceive past events as the being saw them, or as experienced by the raw materials that the creature animates.</p>",

Some Virtues allow a character to take a particular Arcane Ability, but not the others, while other Virtues allow a character to take any Arcane Ability. Any Virtue giving a character a Supernatural Ability that may need to Penetrate Magic Resistance also allows the character to take the Penetrate Ability. Magi without a relevant Virtue may only take Arcane Abilities during or after apprenticeship.</p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">A character with this Ability is able to create a wind, duplicating the effects of any wind-based Creo Auram spell at Range Voice, Target Individual; similar Supernatural Abilities exist for other weather phenomena. To invoke the wind, the character literally has to whistle, and makes a Stamina + Whistle Up The Wind roll, against the Ease Factor listed in the table below. If successful, the wind immediately starts to blow as commanded by the character. It will continue to blow in the same manner even if the character stops whistling. A character who summons a wind at a particular strength can change that wind to another type with a similar strength (such as from <em>Circular Winds of Protection</em> to <em>Broom of the Winds</em>), diminish it to a weaker effect (such as <em>Chamber of Spring Breezes</em>), or end it entirely. Each of these changes requires a Communication + Music roll, using the Ease Factors for Maintaining Concentration on a spell (page @@). Whistling a new tune in this manner cannot increase the strength of a wind, or return a diminished wind to its former intensity; instead the character must make a new Whistle Up The Wind roll. All effects of this Ability diminish to the next lowest level of strength once every 24 hours, when the sun sets, until they dwindle to nothing.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Ease Factor</span></th><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Strength of Wind</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">6</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Light breeze, strong enough to clear a stench from a room</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">9</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Moderate wind, strong enough to affect the accuracy of arrows</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">12</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Strong wind, powerful enough to propel a sailing ship</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">15</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Gale force wind, strong enough to knock someone over</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">18</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Hurricane force wind, strong enough to uproot trees</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\"><strong>Specialities</strong>: at sea, in mountains, during the winter (Supernatural)</span></p></div>",

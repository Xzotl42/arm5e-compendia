    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">This Ability allows the character to summon mundane animals from potentially long distances away. To use this Ability, the character must be capable of making an audible call to the creatures he wishes to summon, and must be within one day's journey of a habitat where the required species are found. The number of animals which respond to his summons is determined by the score in the character’s Ability; see the table below. He must then make a Communication + Summon Animals roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If successful, the animals arrive within 1 hour of the character making the call, although exceeding the Ease Factor by 3 makes them come in 2 minutes, and exceeding it by 6 summons them in a single round.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">The character cannot directly communicate with the animals unless he has another Ability which allows him to do so (such as Animal Ken), and they depart naturally as determined by the storyguide. Even if the character lacks the ability to communicate with the animals, they act as if friendly towards him, and if naturally aggressive, may fight to defend him.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"max-width:80px;\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Ability Score</span></th><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Number of animals arriving</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">1</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">1 animal of Size –2, or equivalent mass (2 of Size –3, 5 of Size –4, 10 of Size –5, 20 of Size –6, etc.)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">2</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">2 animals of Size –2, or equivalent mass (1 of Size –1, 5 of Size –3, 10 of Size –4, 20 of Size –5, etc.)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">3</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">5 animals of Size –2, or equivalent mass (1 of Size 0, 2 of Size –1, 10 of Size –3, 20 of Size –4, etc.)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">4</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">10 animals of Size –2, or equivalent mass (1 of Size +1, 2 of Size 0, 5 of Size –1, 20 of Size –3, etc.)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">5</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">20 animals of Size –2, or equivalent mass (1 of Size +2, 2 of Size +1, 5 of Size 0, 10 of Size –1, etc.)</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\"><strong>Specialities</strong>: a particular type of animal (Supernatural)</span></p></div>",

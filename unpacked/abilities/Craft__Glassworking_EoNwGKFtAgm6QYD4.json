In general, Craft Abilities are distinguished by the material they work with, although you may also take a Craft Ability that allows the character to work with several materials in one specific way. You may purchase Craft more than once, choosing a different one each time. Skill in one Craft does not imply skill in any others. <em>City and</em> Guild contains more detailed information about Craft Abilities and their use, in Chapter 4. <br><strong>Specialties</strong>: as appropriate to the craft.

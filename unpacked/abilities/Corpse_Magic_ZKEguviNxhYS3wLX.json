    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character can use Corpse Magic to temporarily revive a corpse. The target of this Supernatural Ability cannot have received any burial rites from a Divinely-sanctioned religion, and the corpse must be relatively intact, having as a minimum a spine, a skull, and more than half of its long bones. There need not be any flesh remaining. It takes fifteen minutes to chant the spells sufficiently to awaken the dead.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Casting Total: Communication + Corpse Magic + Aura modifier + stress die</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Commanding roll: Communication + Leadership + stress die; Leadership may be limited by Language Ability</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Compare the result to the following Ease Factors to determine success:</p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"min-width:100px;\">Ease Factor Outcome</th><th dir=\"auto\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"auto\">9</td><td dir=\"ltr\">Speak to the dead.

He can leave the presence of the corpse and it will continue to obey its orders, but once they are complete it remains motionless until given another order by its creator.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The corpse animates and sits up, allowing the character converses with it directly. A character who is particularly skilled can cause the corpse to rise out of the grave and walk abroad. The character asks questions or issues commands by making a Communication + Leadership roll; the corpse does nothing unless commanded to do so using a roll of this type. Single word commands have an Ease Factor of 6, simple questions or commands require a 9, and more complex instructions or questions need a 12 or more. The character must know the language that the corpse spoke in life to ask it questions or issue commands. If the character is not fluent in this language (that is, a score of 5 or higher), then the character's Leadership is limited by his Language Ability. Once the character has failed three commanding rolls, the corpse sinks back into its grave or ceases movement, and cannot be subject to Corpse Magic again until the moon has risen. All corpses are also laid to rest if their heads are removed from their body.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Walking corpses typically have a Magic Might of 9 (see <em>Realms of Power: Magic</em>, Chapter 6 for more details). The Penetration Total of the Corpse Magic must exceed this Might to cause it to leave its grave, otherwise it is confined to the earth.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Specialities</strong>: kings, soldiers, compelling truth, animating the dead.

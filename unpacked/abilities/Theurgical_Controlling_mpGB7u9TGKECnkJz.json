    "description": "<p>The elemental theurgist can affect supernatural creatures with Might of the Form appropriate to the element used, assuming he can equal or exceed the being’s Might on his Controlling roll. If he succeeds, the target must carry out a single command to the best of its ability. This can also be used to banish an elemental permanently. If it is held within a container, the elemental may leave while it is about this task, but must immediately return once the command has been fulfilled. According to legend, the earliest elemental theurgists</p><p>would summon elementals into magic jars, and command them to obey the wishes of the person who released them, making them princely gifts. However, to take advantage of this legend, other elementalists would sometimes command the elementals inside such containers to kill the person who freed them instead, to punish thieves and meddlers.</p><p></p>",

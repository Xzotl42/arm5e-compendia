    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Protection from magic. This is a special&nbsp;ritual (not a ritual spell) that takes about two&nbsp;minutes to perform. It lets you add 5 times your&nbsp;Parma Magica score to your magic resistance&nbsp;until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever&nbsp;comes first. You may suppress your Parma&nbsp;Magica temporarily by concentrating; this is&nbsp;equivalent to sustaining a Concentration duration&nbsp;spell. (See page 82). Parma Magica does&nbsp;not require concentration while it is active.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may also protect one other person for&nbsp;each point in Parma Magica, with their consent.&nbsp;You must touch each person to start the&nbsp;protection, and it lasts as long as at least one&nbsp;character can see the other. The magus may&nbsp;cancel the protection at will, at any distance.&nbsp;While a magus is protecting others, his effective&nbsp;Parma Magica score is reduced by 3 points, both for himself and for the other people he is&nbsp;protecting. If the magus has a Parma Magica&nbsp;score of 3 or lower, his Parma Magica provides&nbsp;each character, including himself, with a Magic Resistance of 0. In the magus&rsquo;s case, this is&nbsp;added to his Form resistance, and a magus protected&nbsp;by another magus&rsquo;s Parma Magica may&nbsp;also add his Form resistance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Parma Magica can only be learned by&nbsp;Gifted characters, although they learn it as a normal Arcane Ability, not a Supernatural&nbsp;Ability. It is only known by Hermetic magi, as&nbsp;the Order enforces the &ldquo;Join or Die&rdquo; choice rigorously&nbsp;on anyone who knows it, as well as&nbsp;declaring a Wizard&rsquo;s March on the magus who&nbsp;taught it. Parma Magica is the last thing an&nbsp;apprentice learns, being taught the final key to&nbsp;the Ability after he swears the Oath.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Specialties:&nbsp;</strong>protection from any specific Form.

If you understand the person you are attempting to deceive (roll 9+ on Perception + Folk Ken), you gain a bonus of +1 to your Guile roll. This Ability also covers disguising yourself, and pretending to be something you are not. It is often an opposed roll, against the victim's Perception + Folk Ken or, for disguise, Perception + Awareness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> particular sorts of deception, lying to authority, fast talk, elaborate lies.

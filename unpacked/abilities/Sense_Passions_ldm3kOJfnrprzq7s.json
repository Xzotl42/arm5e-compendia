    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character can sense the personality and desires of an intelligent being by recognizing and identifying the different shades of tarnish on its soul. A Perception + Sense Passions roll against an Ease Factor of 9 lets her sense the most powerful emotion currently being experienced by the person, and a roll against an Ease Factor of 15 allows her to identify the character's most dominant Personality Trait. The effect must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance if it has any kind of supernatural protection, and since this is a Supernatural Ability, it is affected by auras.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Sense Passions: stress die + Perception + Sense Passions + Aura</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Through careful examination, the character can also recognize passions in people within the general area, allowing her to hone in on the most powerful source of emotion within sight, usually the character with the highest (or lowest) Personality Trait. This requires a 12 or better on the Sense Passions roll.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character can also tell when an aura has a tarnish (se <em>Realms of Power: The Infernal,</em> page 13<em>)</em> or temper (see <em>Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition</em>, page 38) and its type or types by overcoming an Ease Factor of 6.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">By sensing passions, the character can often recognize incorporeal spirits. You may treat Sense Passions as Second Sight when attempting to recognize the presence of invisible or bodiless beings. However, this does not allow her to see through illusions, even illusions of strong emotions, and she cannot actually see the spirits, merely sense their proximity.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">In addition, this Ability allows the character to Sense Holiness and Unholiness in a limited fashion, much like the Sense Holiness and Unholiness Ability. She can tell that something is either holy or unholy, but she cannot distinguish between the two. She feels the emotional presence associated with the Divine or the Infernal, but cannot pinpoint its supernatural origin. Thus, she might mistake a demon with a fair shape for an angel, or a fearsome-looking angel for a demon. By identifying the target's primary emotions or desires, however, you can usually get a good idea of which realm the target is associated with, assuming the character can penetrate its Magic Resistance.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Sense Passions is either a false power (see the False Power Flaw), or is associated with the Infernal. This means that it always appears infernal to divine or infernal detection. The presence of Infernal taint allows the Sense Holiness and Unholiness aspect to work. If the troupe allows Divine powers to be false, this may be the false version of Sense Holiness and Unholiness. </p><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Specialties</strong>: auras, emotions, Personality Traits, in a general area.

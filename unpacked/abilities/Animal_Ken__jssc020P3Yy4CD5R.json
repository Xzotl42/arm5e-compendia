Treat your score in Animal Ken as your score in a language that the animal speaks fluently in order to determine how well you can communicate, and you can use Animal Handling as a substitute for any social abilities affecting humans. Beyond this, this virtue has no effect on the attitude of animals to you, or you to animals. Other people cannot understand your communication with the animals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> a particular type of animal, a particular type of communication.

    "description": "<p>A local tradition of minor practitioners of magic has fallen under the control of the covenant. These servants of the covenant can have mystical abilities, but their talents do not vary much between practitioners. They provide useful information about their activities to the covenant, and aid it in minor ways. For example, in Loch Leglean, a covenant controls all of the midwives in the Stirling area. They collect useful information and perform minor magic to aid the covenant.</p>",

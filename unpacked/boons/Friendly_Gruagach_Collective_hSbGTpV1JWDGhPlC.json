    "description": "<p>This is a variant of the Hedge Tradition Covenant Boon (see Covenants page 21). </p><p>The covenant has significant control over a nearby gruagach collective. The collective uses its close ties to the community to provide useful information to the covenant about events in the countryside, trades vis with the covenant, and warns the covenant of magical events in the area. Its members also provide minor magical aid on a regular basis, and fight for the covenant if there is a crisis.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The covenant, and its members, is well regarded. This may be because of previous actions, such as defeating a monster, or because of continuing features of the covenant, such as a superb library. The covenant has a Reputation score of 3. This Boon may be taken several times, with the prestige applying to a different group each time. </p><p>Marco, a Redcap many caution not to trust, claims to have visited a covenant whose women are as beautiful as a rainbow. Suitors come from far lands to seek the hand of scullions, maids, and washerwomen, and faerie princes send obscure gifts to the widow who owns the castle.</p>",

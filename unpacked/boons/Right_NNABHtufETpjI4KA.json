    "description": "<p>The covenant has been granted the right by some powerful individual or organization (usually a noble) to collect income from a privileged source. Examples include the right to collect the flotsam of shipwrecks, seize a portion of all smuggled goods found, exploit a royal monopoly, harvest timber in a royal forest, fish a certain river (or keep the royal fish, the sturgeon), or collect tolls on a road or at a village gate. The right is often vested in a companion, to separate the covenant from feudal obligation. Note that this Boon does not provide an extra source of income, it merely ensures that one existing source enjoys a measure of protection and legitimacy that it otherwise would not have.</p>",

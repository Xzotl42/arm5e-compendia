The covenant may be connected to land either by a wooden bridge or by a stone causeway, although paranoid magi might disdain either structure. The covenantâ€™s buildings are not useful as defensive works. </p><p>Settling an island does not alarm nearby noblemen, although they might start demanding taxes from what they see as a village. This is not a castle.</p>",

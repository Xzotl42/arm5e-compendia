    "description": "<p>The covenantâ€™s defenders live as farmers for the rest of the year. They do not practice at weapons during the year, but most are competent with an inexpensive weapon and are extremely fit. Covenants usually cannot call up large numbers of men during the planting or harvesting seasons. The advantage to peasant warriors is that they are never paid wages: a certain amount of military service is expected of them as part of their rent.</p>",

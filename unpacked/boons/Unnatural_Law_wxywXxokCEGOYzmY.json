    "description": "<p>Within the covenantâ€™s aura, a series of natural laws are suspended. For example, in the Covenant of the Castle of Fees, glass is as durable and hard as iron, and is used as a building material and armament. In the Covenant of the Solemn Scholars, children are able to fly until they lose their virginity. </p><p>This Boon is suitable for covenants that want to play against genre. For example, there is a covenant powered by wonderful machines copied from the works of Heron of Alexandria. These steam rotators permit the covenant to manufacture many other wondrous devices, which fail to work if taken from the covenant. It also allows the troupe to strongly contrast the home of the magi to the mundane world.</p>",

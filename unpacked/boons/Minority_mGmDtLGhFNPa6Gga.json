    "description": "<p>The mundane settlements near the covenant have many representatives of a foreign cultural group, which has its own customs and folk-magical practices. Members of the group might settle in the covenant, if offered a better life than in the surrounding settlements. </p><p>A covenant in England has many Jews among its covenfolk. They find the covenant a liberating community. The magi do not prohibit them from owning land, do not prevent them from entering trades, and do not force them to wear a white clothing patch. The covenant’s friendliness toward Jews must be kept secret, however, because the King of England has owned all Jews in his kingdom, and all of their property, since the Laws of Edward the Confessor were drafted in the 12th century. The laws allow a rich man to have Jews if he buys a special license, but the covenant has so many of the king’s chattels in its employ that it would not be able to give him the required money without raising the ire of the Quaesitores.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Boon is only suited to high-fantasy sagas. The covenant is in an environment where only constant magical intervention can sustain human life. A covenant under the sea, or floating in a lake of lava under the Earth, is in a fantastic environment. A covenant in Arcadia is also in a fantastic environment. Covenants set in these environments usually have little difficulty with mundane humans: invasion is nearly impossible. There are no neighboring nobles or churchmen, and spies are almost unheard of.</p>",

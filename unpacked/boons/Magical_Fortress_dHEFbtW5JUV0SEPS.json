    "description": "<p>An alternative to mundane castle-building is the construction of a fortress by magic. The magical fortresses that are possible with the assistance of Hermetic magic are near limitless, and this catch-all Boon is designed to give players a blank slate upon which to describe their fancy. Mystical fortresses are often built on sites with the Unnatural Law Boon. </p><p>There are many examples of mystical fortresses in Hermetic and mundane folklore. One castle spins on its axis to make assault impossible. Automatons of brass defend another castle. A third is carved from the living body of an enormous tree, while it is said that in distant Africa, a small castle has been built on the back of the worldâ€™s greatest elephant. Hermetic scholars have speculated upon covenants deep under the sea, or floating on clouds. </p><p>A surprising number of Hermetic magi will lend their assistance to the construction of mystical fortresses. Many wish to see how it will work. Some magi see mobile fortresses as a way of waging war or engaging in trade. Others, who advocate a retreat from contact with mundanes, are interested in colonizing inhospitable environments. </p><p>A Magical Fortress requires the Castle Hook if a powerful noble is likely to become aware of, and concerned by, the site.</p>",

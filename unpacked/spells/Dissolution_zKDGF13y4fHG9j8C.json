Armor drips off its wearer, swords collapse like melting butter, and so forth. At the end of the round, the matter re-solidifies into its new shape. If the item is enchanted, the elemental's Penetration must exceed five times the total pawns of vis invested. The moisture of living bodies prevents them from such a devastating effect; nevertheless, hair, toenails, teeth, claws, and bone are all affected, inflicting +15 damage and ignoring protection from armor.

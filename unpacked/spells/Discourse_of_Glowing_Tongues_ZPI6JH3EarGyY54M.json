    "description": "This spell controls the sounds created by a fire to make them form words. The alteration is subtle; words are formed of the natural roar, crackles, and hisses of the fire — not with any additional sound. Someone listening at the fire who knows to expect the words can make them out with a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 3. A character who is not aware that the fire is speaking needs to roll against an Ease Factor of 9 on a Perception + Awareness test to realize that the fire is making words at all.\nRanulf and his apprentice (who is also quite talented with the Art of Ignem) use this spell to target fires that are subject to the Unified Flame spell. Because the Unified Flame is cast by Ranulf within his covenant, the communication is not impeded by his covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth. Neither Ranulf nor his apprentice knows Discourse of Glowing Tongues as a formulaic spell; instead, they cast it spontaneously when needed. Note that this spell has a Range of Touch and may be difficult or even damaging to cast on a particularly hot fire.",

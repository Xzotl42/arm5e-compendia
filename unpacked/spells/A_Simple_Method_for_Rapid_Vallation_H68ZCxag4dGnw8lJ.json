    "description": "The sciences of vallation, surrounding your forces with walls, and countervallation, surrounding your enemies with a wall to cut off their supply lines, were well understood by the Romans. They could not, however, accomplish these feat as easily as a Tremere Architect. This spell makes a wall of granite up to 500 paces wide, 5 paces high, and 1 pace thick. One needs minerâ€™s tools to break through it, though it can be toppled if it is not connected to a support on its side or top. The wall this spell creates has a walkway, protected by crenellations, along one side. Architects who plan to use this spell often master it, because during the Corruption of Tytalus, a Tremere magus had the misfortune to botch this spell. The walkway appeared on the enemy side.",

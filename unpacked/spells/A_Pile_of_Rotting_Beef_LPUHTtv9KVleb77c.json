    "description": "Bees, which are vital for the production of most crops, are generated by the decay of the corpses of cows. Player characters who create too many bees before they have flowers must watch them starve, but players who have flowers, and no bees, must watch them wither. Fortunately, things generated by magically created animals persist even if the spellâ€™s duration ends. Clever magi can simply strew their island with dead cows, using Sun duration spells like this one, and the bees which arise from these corpses are natural.\nThis spell creates ten cow carcasses.\nMagi wanting to absolutely ensure they have bees can add a Perdo requisite, to make the corpses rot as they wish. Alternatively they can use spells like Growth of Creeping Things, bees being one of the insects created when destroying beef.",

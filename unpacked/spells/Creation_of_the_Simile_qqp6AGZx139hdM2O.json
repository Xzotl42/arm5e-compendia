    "description": "This spell creates a new category of thing in the mind of the viewer, granting unconscious familiarity with a broad range of instances of that thing. Alternatively, the spell may be used to grant a broad knowledge of a category of thing of which the target is already aware. A magus deeply familiar with a simile, as described earlier, may make the target deeply familiar with the simile, while a magus only broadly familiar with a simile may only create broad familiarity in the target.\nThis spell is usually created with a long Range and Duration, because it allows the magus to create unreal similes in the minds of hostile targets. This is most effective when the target does not already have a ready category for the thing the magus wishes to hide. As an example, a magus carting odd spell components into a city may convince the guards that they are “geegaws,” or some other meaningless category, and thus unimportant.\nThis will not work if the guard already has a simile that includes things that look like spell components, for example “tools of the Devil.”",

    "description": "The caster can fly. He must make an Intelligence + Finesse roll to change direction or speed; with an Ease Factor related to his current speed — Ease Factor 3 for walking pace, Ease Factor 9 at moderate speed, Ease Factor 12 at maximum speed.\nHe can move at a maximum speed as fast as a running horse — about forty miles an hour — but this is reduced by one mile an hour for every point of Load he carries. He cannot physically carry a load which inflicts a Burden more than five points greater than his Strength (i.e. 15 points of Load for a character with Strength 0, 10 points of Load for - character with Strength — 1, etc.). A second, unencumbered individual is a Load of 21 on average (see Grogs, Chapter 4).\nConcentration Duration is better than Sun Duration for this spell since in the former case the caster can end it at will, but the effect is often enchanted into an item that maintains concentration for the caster, for added safety.",

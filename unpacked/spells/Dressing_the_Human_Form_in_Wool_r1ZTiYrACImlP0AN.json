    "description": "This spell crafts a single woolen garment from either raw fleeces or from spun wool. This spell is suitable for producing a cotte, cyclas, ganache, bliaut, cappa, or chausses (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert). A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 12 if raw fleece is employed, or 9 if the base material is spun wool. The clothes produced are of standard quality; increase the Ease Factor for particularly fine or complex craft. If the Finesse roll fails, the caster is left with a useless mess of wool. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items, later). She does not have a spell that directly creates mundane clothing of wool due to the difficulty (it would be a similar spell to Sturdy Mantle of the Traveler, earlier). Instead, it is much easier to simply create fleeces (see Shearing the Unseen Flock, later) and then craft them into clothing with this spell. This spell employs the Level 3 Rego Animal guideline on page 50 of Covenants', “treat and process items made of animal products.”",

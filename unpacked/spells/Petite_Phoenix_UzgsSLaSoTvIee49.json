    "description": "This transmutes a fire into the shape of a small bird. The reshaped fire moves as the will of the caster directs. The fire has a Size of-6, a Dexterity of +3, and a Quickness of+7. The heat of the original blaze is unchanged by this spell. The bird has no more substance than the original fire did and is not subject to most types of attacks, but still may be extinguished with water, Perdo Ignem magics, and similar methods. Being made entirely of flame, the petite phoenix can not pass through solid objects, but objects that are smaller than the bird may pass through it. Ranulf often uses Petite Phoenix in conjunction with Transmutation of Fire to move objects such as doors and inconvenient sections of walls. Fires targeted by this spell can be up to ten times the size of a hearth fire.",

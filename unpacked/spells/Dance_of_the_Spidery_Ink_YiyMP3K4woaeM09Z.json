    "description": "This effect causes a small quantity of text (up to a page) to form into a spidery creature and walk from one piece of paper or vellum to another. The two pieces of paper or vellum are held in either hand of the caster. Casting the spell transfers the text to the second piece of paper or vellum.\nNote that this spell does not attempt to understand the moving text in any way. In order to preserve the sense of the text, the caster must make a Dex + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (if he understands the text) or 12 (if he does not understand the text).\nFor this spell to work, the ink must be made of a plant product (which is common). A similar spell designed with an Animal, Corpus, or Terram Form will be needed if the ink is an animal, human, or mineral product.\nSimilar spells with longer durations and a Group target could be invented to transfer the entire text from a large work. For a Lab Text, for every magnitude of effect (level divided by 5), it takes one hour to move the text. For a summa or tractatus, it takes one hour to move the text per point of Source Quality. Note that this only moves the text from one place to another; it does not create a copy of the text.\nThe Muto requisite is required to make the ink stick to the new piece of parchment.",

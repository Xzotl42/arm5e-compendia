    "description": "This spell dispels the Parma Magica of the target. The target’s Parma Magica Score must be less than (25 + stress die) divided by 5. The target can, of course, recast his Parma Magica in subsequent rounds, but the target may not notice that his Parma Magic has been dispelled until it is too late.\nObviously, this spell is only really useful for attacking other magi. Thus, some tribunals may view magi who are known to have invented this spell with suspicion. On the other hand, there are legitimate reasons for knowing this spell — prosecuting Wizard’s War and hunting Marched magi are entirely legal and uncontroversial pursuits.\nLike all spells, this spell must Penetrate to be effective. Higher-level versions of this are possible for attacking targets with greater Parma Magica scores.\nNote that this spell uses the Perdo Vim guideline, which dispels magic effects of a specific type (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 160). Parma Magica is an example of a magical effect of a specific type, which all Hermetic magi are familiar with. This is why Wind of Mundane Silence (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161), which dispels all magical effects is effective against Parma Magica. This spell does not dispel Magic Resistance generated via other sources, nor is this spell effective against any other sorts of magic.",

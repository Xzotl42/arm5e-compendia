    "description": "The caster creates six walls of fire within the range of his spell. Each wall is up to 10 paces long. These walls can be created in any configuration desired by the caster, including configurations where the walls intersect one another. If a particularly precise placement of the walls is desired, the caster should make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine his success. Using Stockade of Infernos to directly attack a creature by placing a wall of fire across that creatureâ€™s location may be accomplished using the rules for aimed spells. Anyone passing through one of the walls takes +15 fire damage. Ranulf frequently places his walls as a set of two concentric triangles, or as a narrow path that leaves people trapped within them only a single direction to move.",

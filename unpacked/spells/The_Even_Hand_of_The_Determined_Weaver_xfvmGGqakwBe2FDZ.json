    "description": "Like The Weaver's Subtle Art (below), this spell makes a lasting change to a tapestry or other item made from cloth (whether made from wool, cotton, silk, or linen). Any geometric shape or regular line in or on the item, or even the shape of the item itself, can be made even and precise. The Creo requisite ensures that the lines and shapes affected by this spell are perfect examples of their type.\nThis spell is used to enhance items, especially when making Excellent-quality wares, or Items of Quality as per the Verditius House Mystery detailed in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 124.\nThe application of this spell alone is not enough to raise the true quality of an item (it cannot be made more hardy or more richly colored, for instance), but it is enough to aid spells that require certain mathematical resonances.\nThe individual changes made by the spell may stand out and draw the eye of those interested in the piece. Those looking at the work should make a Perception + Awareness + simple die roll against an Ease Factor of 9. On a success they notice the precision of the affected areas. Those who have the ability may substitute their Weaver craft ability for Awareness when making the check.\nA Herbam casting requisite is required for tapestries that include plant-based cloth or yarn.",

    "description": "This spell creates a circle that humans lacking Magic Resistance cannot cross. The spell gently pushes the target away from the ring. It is used to bar entry in many Hermetic sancta.\nThis spell has an alternate name, Tytalus s Prison, which comes from a story, possibly apocryphal, from the life of the Founder Tytalus. It suggests that in the early years of the Order, he cast down a wizard living as a feudal lord in the Rhineland, in part by trapping his mustered army inside a ring placed about the army camp. Members of House Tremere claim a similar feat for one of their early archimagi. Their story seems more likely because he was a vallationist, a builder of magical walls, which explains why the army was not able to deface the ring and escape. It is possible that this is a trick of Guorna the Fetid’s, which both magi knew. The second name also hints at an alternative use of the spell in a magus’s sanctum: to imprison an apprentice inside.",

    "description": "Some waterways, especially those near estuaries, are surrounded by marshland. However, there are techniques for building up and draining the land. This can take many seasons of work, with a large team of laborers working in very difficult conditions. The draining of marshland through the digging of drainage channels and the building of dykes is known as inning. This ritual allows the magus to drain an area 300 by 300 paces to the point that it is dry and stable, as though a season had been spent inning the land. The Aquam requisite is used to move the standing water outside the spell boundary, which makes the inning work easier than normal.\nThis spell uses the rules for Rego Craft Magic {Covenants, page 49) and as such the magus must make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the success and quality of his work. In this case, the Ease Factor is 15 (Base 9 + 6 for a season’s work). Failure means that, while the drainage ditches may have been dug, they are either too shallow or too few to drain the land. If left, the land is likely to remain waterlogged and building on it is impossible.",

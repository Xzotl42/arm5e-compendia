    "description": "The target grows two more arms. These extra manipulators enhance certain Dexterity tasks such as climbing, and Strength rolls representing the extra muscle power available to the target, such as forcing open doors. In these situations the target receives a +3 bonus to his total. Additionally, the target can wield an additional set of weapons in combat. He can now manage either two single weapons and two shields, or a Great weapon and a shield. If fighting singly, the character makes two attacks per round, one with each set of weapons. If fighting as a group, consider the group to have an extra member, who does not count against the Leadership Ability of the group leader, if any. This extra member is excluded when determining the damage taken by the group. Casting requisites are necessary to adjust the targets in an appropriate manner, else clothing rips and armor hampers the use of the new limbs. Starkad Aludreng was a hero descended from the Norse giants; he possessed eight arms and fought with four swords.",

    "description": "Like all spells of Bargain Duration, this spell is cast immediately after the caster strikes a bargain with the target, and only takes effect if the target breaks his part of the bargain (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 92). If it should come to pass that the target of this spell breaks the agreement within a year of the date when the deal was made, then the target’s memory is destroyed, removing every stored idea that the target possesses and his sense of identity. All General Abilities (including languages) are retained, but knowledge of Academic, Arcane, Martial, and Supernatural Abilities are lost, as are all Arts. The target’s imagination, which stores images, is not affected, so he recognizes the faces of people he knows, places he has been, and songs he has heard, but lacks all knowledge about those things such as names, locations, emotional importance, and so forth. Lambert secured a Lab Text for this spell from the Merinita who developed it, in exchange for a copy of the Lab Text for Oath Breaker’s Confession. Lambert wanted to have a spell that provided a profoundly serious consequence for breaking an agreement, and the creator of Mind Cleansed of Treachery wished to acquire a spell that left its targets in a condition that could still be negotiated with.",

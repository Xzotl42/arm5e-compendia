    "description": "Heals all damage to all human bodies in the room at the conclusion of the ritual. The targets must have been present in the room for the entire length of the ritual to benefit from the spell. The spell can only heal wounds, not such damage as missing limbs, or diseases and damage from poisons.\nThis improved version of the Incantation of the Body Made Whole was commissioned by a Tremere magus who wanted to save vis while healing a large group of wounded people. To use this during (or better, after) a battle, a tent may be used instead of a room. Using Target: Room rather than Group means that this spell can heal more wounded, if one can get all of them into a single room.",

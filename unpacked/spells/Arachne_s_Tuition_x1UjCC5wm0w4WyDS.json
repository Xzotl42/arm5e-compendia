    "description": "Cast by a master on his apprentice, this spell allows the master to control the apprentice’s movements for a day. The caster can suspend the spell, allowing the apprentice to continue with a task or exercise, and then resume control in order to help the apprentice through a particularly complex task or to correct his student and show how something should be done. The apprentice learns at a much deeper level by having his own actions controlled from within, rather than simply being guided from without.\nThis spell is designed to assist with the training of physical skills, notably craft skills. Each season a master uses this spell to instruct an apprentice, he can add 1 to his Training Source Quality (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 164).\nThis version was developed generations ago within Petallichus’ line of Verditius weavers, though others certainly exist elsewhere within House Verditius and perhaps also in other Houses.\nTwo seasons of using this spell on an apprentice counts as one year of being under a constant magical effect as per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 168, and inflicts 1 Warping point in that year.",

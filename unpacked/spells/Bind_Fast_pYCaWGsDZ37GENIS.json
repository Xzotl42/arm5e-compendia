    "description": "The targets’ clothes seek out and bind themselves to the nearest other object, moving or not. If the members of a group are standing sufficiently close, this spell binds them together. The magic lasts just long enough for the clothes to bind themselves into knots, and then dissipates allowing the targets to free themselves by undoing or cutting the knotted cloth.\nWhile all of a target’s surface clothing will writhe and seek out something to bind to, there is no guarantee that all of it can. If the clothes are close-fitting, or there is not enough slack in the garment, the cloth will simply flail for a moment and then fall dormant. If there is sufficient cloth but there is nothing within its reach, the target may still become bound up as his clothes wrap and tie themselves around his limbs.\nAffected targets suffer a -3 penalty to all subsequent rolls for physical actions, but can free themselves by either dedicating a round to cutting or tearing the clothing, or by spending two rounds working to untie the knots.\nStoryguides may wish to give other options to particularly large, strong, or dexterous characters.\nUntil members of the target group have freed themselves, successive castings of this spell have no further effect.",

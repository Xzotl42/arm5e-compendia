    "description": "This spell represents a larger variant of the Cloak of Darkness, and removes all light from the designated target area. The effect manifests in the form of a irregular sphere of writhing darkness that contains everything within three paces of the affected target. Anyone inside the affected space is effectively blind. To see through the area from either side, a spell that permits the target to see in complete darkness, like Eyes of the Bat, is required.\nThe spell must be targeted at an object, individual, or other specific point in space. This location functions as a focus for the effect only, as the spell targets the light within the Part of space surrounding the focus, rather than the focus itself. Thus, the spell does not have to penetrate the Magic Resistance of anyone inside the target area, but only the resistance of the focus. If it fails to penetrate, the spell fails. If the focus is an individual or object that moves, the created darkness moves along with it. For example, if the spell is cast on a pebble, and that pebble is thrown into a lake, the blob of darkness will sink to the bottom.",

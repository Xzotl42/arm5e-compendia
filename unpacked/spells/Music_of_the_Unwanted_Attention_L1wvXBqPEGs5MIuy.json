    "description": "The caster is able to sense anyone who is currently aware of her. A person’s attention, regardless how fleeting, is heard as a musical chime, and each individual is represented by a different tone. She doesn’t detect any information about them other than they are aware of her existence. The information gained from this spell is only relevant for the moment that the spell is cast, and is only applicable to those who have an active interest in the caster’s presence. This spell operates by interrogating the common sense (see Art & Academe, page 33) for images of the caster.",

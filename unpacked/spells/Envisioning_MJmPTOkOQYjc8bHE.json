A demon cannot instantly make substantial changes to a dream, but can gradually twist it to take on a darker and frightening tone, and can speak through any figure from the victim's subconscious. A waking dream is more obvious; the victim suffers an immediate and powerful hallucination of whatever the demon desires. This may be so frightening that the victim is stunned for a round, and must make a Brave Personality roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or have an extreme reaction, such as retching, convulsions or abject terror. This is the only way in which a spiritual demon can communicate with mortals.</span></p>",

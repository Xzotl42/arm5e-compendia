    "description": "This spell alters the target’s recollection of an event, changing the memories of what actually occurred into memories of a different event decided upon by the caster. This spell is undone by speaking to a specific individual about the altered memories, and the individual who releases the spell must be included in the altered memories in some significant way. For example, the individual could be discussed, the memories could include a prominently placed picture of the individual, or the individual could be “present” in the altered memories. Often the spell is cast to change the recollections of an event into the recollections of a conversation specifying exactly how the spell is to be broken.\nA Tytalus maga who had need of sending agents to areas where they might be subject to investigation by Mentem spells convinced Lambert’s mater to allow Lambert to study the Lab Text for this spell as an apprentice. Lambert then used the spell for the benefit of the Tytalus who compensated Lambert’s mater for the service. The vis cost of performing the ritual, and the rarity of people willing to trust a Gifted magus sufficiently to allow their memories to be altered, prevents this from being a frequently used tool.",

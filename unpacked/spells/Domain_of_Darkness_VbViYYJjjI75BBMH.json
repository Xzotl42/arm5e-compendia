    "description": "This ritual creates a domain of darkness in the designated Boundary, which can cover an area with a diameter of nearly 1000 paces. No natural light that is brighter than a soft evening glow is ever shed within its Boundary, regardless of the season or time of day. Due to the continuous lack of sun, the whole area becomes cold and uncomfortable for living beings. Warm air from outside is not actively resisted, but almost never reaches the center of the domain. Even fires created by mundane or magical means appear weak, and only dimly lit. Plants within the Boundary turn to leafless caricatures of life sooner or later. Note that a Boundary requires a well- defined border, such as the tree line of a grove, the cliffs of a steep valley, or the shore of an island.\nA brief note on the specific use of this spell that should not to be mistaken for traits or side-effects of the spell itself: The area affected by Domain of Darkness provides a haven for all creatures that shun the light. It represents Tolides’ latest attempt to establish some sort of abode in a domain of his own. Because the affected Boundary is inhabited by a practicing diabolist, and the ritual needed to cast the spell is often powered by Infernal vis, the aura of the Boundary slowly but steadily accumulates more and more traits of Infernal Warping. For example, animals that stay inside the domain for an extended period of time are likely to turn into Corrupted Beasts — repellent aberrations of nature {Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 77). One day, the affected Boundary might even become a regio of its own, which is exactly what Tolides has planned.",

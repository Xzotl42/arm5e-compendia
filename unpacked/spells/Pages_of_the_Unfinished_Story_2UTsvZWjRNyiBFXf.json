    "description": "This spell requires a piece of parchment written on by a character, such as a page of Lab Text or part of a tractatus. The caster holds the piece of parchment against the wall of a structure (such as a tower), and all pages of parchment written on by the same author, in the last week, within the tower instantly transport into the caster’s hand.\nMost authors would immediately notice that their work has been stolen when they return to their writing table. If more than two weeks’ writing is stolen through successive castings of this spell, any Laboratory work on which the author is working will be interrupted.\nThis spell uses the Rego Corpus guideline to instantly transport a body, by analogy, to transport animal products.\nNote that who wrote the text on a piece of parchment is a part of the history and origins of an animal product (the parchment), which can be detected with an Intellego Animal effect. This is why an Intellego requisite is required.\nThis spell only gathers material written by the same character who wrote the sample. Thus, if the sample piece was in fact written by a scribe, instead of by the expected magus, then this spell will collect work written by the scribe.\nAn equivalent Herbam spell could be used to gather text written on paper or papyrus, but parchment (which is made from animal hide) is the most common form of writing surface used in the Order of Hermes.",

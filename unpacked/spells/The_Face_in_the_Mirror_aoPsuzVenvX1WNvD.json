    "description": "This spell forces a ghost to possess a magus, but allows the magus to maintain control. This brings the ghost inside Personal range and allows mental communication. The Tremere magus can follow the ghost’s advice and allow it control of his muscles, to use skills. The ghost is usually purged from the magus’s body if the Parma Magica is raised during the duration of this spell, so Tremere Assessors tend to use it briefly, in cities, for urgent, vital tasks. Possession is treated like level 25 Rego Mentem effect.\nThis spell does not summon a ghost. Its designer assumed that he would have the ghost he wished to use stored in a mirror. Tremere magi are supplied with ghosts by Leadworkers, or call them up.\nThis spell allows the magus to give the ghost complex, unbreakable instructions, but Assessors find it best to convince their ghosts to assist. This is not difficult, because most ghosts are tied to the Earth by a piece of unfinished business that they cannot accomplish. The Tremere can usually bargain for the ghost’s assistance, in exchange for the resolution of its problem.",

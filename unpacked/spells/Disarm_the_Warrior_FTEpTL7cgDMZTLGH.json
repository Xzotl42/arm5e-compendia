    "description": "Causes a single object within range to fly towards Hugh; he may attempt to catch it if he wishes by succeeding on a Dexterity + Athletics roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If he chooses not to attempt to catch the item, it falls to the ground by his feet. The spell is very forceful, and has an equivalent Strength of +5; if the object is being held by someone else, then make an opposed Strength roll. If the caster rolls higher then the item is lost to its holder. Hugh usually uses this effect to disarm his opponents, or to retrieve his weapons should they not be to hand.",

    "description": "Given an amount of linen or cotton cloth, the caster forms it into a garment according to her specifications. Typical garments made with this spell are the chainse or braies (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert in Magi of Hermes) which are traditionally made of linen. A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 9 for clothes of standard quality since it represents a day’s work done in an instant. If the Finesse roll fails the caster is left with a useless pile of scraps of cloth. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items).\nIf starting with raw flax or cotton fibers, this spell would have needed to use the level 5 Rego Herbam guideline “treat and process items made of plant products” given in Covenants, page 51. Julia has no need for this version, since her Faerie Blood allows her to effect the transformation from fiber to cloth anyway.",

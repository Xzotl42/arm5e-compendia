    "description": "When this spell is cast, the magus chooses a specific question. For the duration of the spell, the caster will hear a voice answering this question from each mind that he comes in contact with. The thoughts of minds that have dwelled heavily on the magus’s question are perceived as clear voices, the thoughts of minds that have given the matter little thought are perceived as loud whispers. Minds that have never considered the issue (and minds that are protected by Magic Resistance that the spell failed to penetrate) do not make any sound at all. Lambert has on occasion, by use of this spell, heard the opinions of spirits and invisible creatures to which he would have otherwise have been oblivious.\nIf the caster is surrounded by many people, the noise generated by this spell can interfere with the caster’s ability to hear normal sounds. The Ease Factor of rolls involving listening should be increased if the caster is surrounded by people with strong opinions while this spell is in effect.",

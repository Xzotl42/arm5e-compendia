    "description": "A huge net of thick threads grows in the indicated area, filling a space 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports the nets can hang vertically, forming a wall, otherwise they act just like a fishing net. Everyone caught in the area is captured within the nets. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9+; or else someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Fire is exceptionally effective against the nets, but risks burning anyone caught within. The nets are not sticky, and cannot trap anyone who stumbles into them.\nThis spell is a deliberate reference to the better-known spell Weaver's Trap of Webs, but the thought of emulating a spider is abhorrent to the arachnophobic Julia. Consequently, her version of this spell is less potent, as linen threads are less strong than spider’s silk.",

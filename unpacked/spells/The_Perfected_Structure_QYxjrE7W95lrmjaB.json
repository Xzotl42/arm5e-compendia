    "description": "An entire building is reshaped to be perfect, if this can be accommodated by small adjustments to the whole and to the rooms within. Both the exterior and the rooms within become regular: rightangled and with straight sides, or perfectly circular. Irregularities in workmanship are easily perfected, but the building is not redesigned.\nNormal medieval building design often prevents this spell from working: most medieval buildings have irregular extensions and out-buildings requiring redesign to count as regular â€” although demolition of the extensions is an easy corrective option. If the whole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can usually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of the Well- Designed Chamber.\nA building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. It is also stronger and more stable against tremors and storms, and has a pleasing air to those beholding it, or living and working within. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.\nIf there is doubt about the limits of perfection, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.) The Mystery of Hermetic Architecture teaches how to enchant this effect into a building so that the enchantment sustains the perfection indefinitely.",

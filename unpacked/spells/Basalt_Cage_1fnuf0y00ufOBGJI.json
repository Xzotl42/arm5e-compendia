    "description": "This ritual creates a large cage made out of basalt stone with a single gate (also made of basalt) that can be opened and shut. The cage is large enough to hold ten man-sized creatures. Individuals in the cage may find it difficult to escape, if the gate is somehow locked or barred. However, the main purpose of the ritual is to create a cage which is subsequently enchanted as an item with the effect The Entrapped Flame.\nNote that, if your character is talented at Rego magics, he may find it easier to use a Rego Terram craft effect to sculpt such a cage from a hunk of basalt. However, remember to consider that the magus must make a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 24 to succeed in casting such a Rego craft effect, as it would be hard for a mundane craftsman to sculpt such an item and it would take him a long time to do so (see Covenants page 49).",

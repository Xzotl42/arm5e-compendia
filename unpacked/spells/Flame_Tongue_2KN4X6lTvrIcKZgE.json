    "description": "This spell causes a glutinous glob of lava (from a lake or river of magma) to leap out and hit something. The volume of lava moved is about 2 cubic feet, and it can be moved to hit any location within Voice range. Whatever the lava hits takes between +15 and +60 damage, depending on how much of it is covered by the lava. The lava sticks to whatever it hits and continues to inflict damage each round. It takes several days for the lava to cool naturally.\nThe heat of the lava is also sufficient to ignite anything flammable that it hits.\nFlame Tongue is an Aimed spell, with a +6 bonus to hit due to the size of the volume of lava.\nIf the caster tries to totally immerse a person with the lava projectile, there is a -6 penalty to the Aiming Roll (effectively canceling the +6 size bonus). There is no penalty to the Aiming Roll if the objective is to merely splash someone. In some circumstances, the storyguide may decide that a missed attack to immerse a character results in a splash.",

    "description": "This spell animates a wooden or woodenhafted melee weapon in someone else’s hand, and makes that weapon attack its holder until the wielder is dead or the weapon is destroyed. When the spell is cast, the weapon tries to break its wielder’s hold (Quickness - Encumbrance stress roll of 9+ to hang on). On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls of 6+, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder’s grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder’s behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores. The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has no Soak, and is “killed” after it takes a wound depending on its size. One-handed weapons must take a Medium Wound, while two- handed weapons must take a Heavy Wound. The damage of thrusting and missile weapons is halved when attacking the renegade weapon.",

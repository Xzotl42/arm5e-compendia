    "description": "This spell allows Alexander to turn a group of people, and their Animal-based equipment, into bats. It was designed to be used as a spell that would allow his grogs to rapidly retreat from danger, but the effect Alexander desired is slightly beyond his skill, so he needs to draw a circle before the spell can be used. He plans to use it only in emergencies, because his grogs will lose those items of equipment that are not based on animal products when it is used, which includes their weapons. If forced to use this spell to flee a foe, Alexander plans to use Clouds of Obscuring Sand, and perhaps Ward Against the Sirocco first. He has a piece of bat leather in a small bag of trinkets he always carries, to use as a physical prop if this spell is cast.",

    "description": "This ritual spell mends a damaged wooden musical instrument. The instrument is returned to the peak of its former condition; that is, the height of its playing life after the instrument had matured and settled, and before decay or accident had affected it. The instrument is also cleaned of all dirt by this spell, as that helps bring it closer to its ideal.\nInstruments that have more than one part, such as a fiddle and its original bow, are treated as the same item and are both repaired so long as all parts are present at the ritual’s casting.\nA badly made instrument cannot be repaired beyond the height of its playing life, so it retains any flaws it had before it was damaged. An enchanted instrument can be made whole again, but any magical enchantments lost as a result of damage are not restored.\nThis spell has a base level of 15 by analogy with the Creo Corpus guidelines, allowing the healing of “light” damage. Casting requisites are needed for instruments with any non-Herbam components (cat-gut, horse hair, metal pins, etc.).",

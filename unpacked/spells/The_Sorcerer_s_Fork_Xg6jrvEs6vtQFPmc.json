    "description": "This spell splits another spell (whose level must not exceed the level of this spell) into two or more identical spells of reduced power, which may be cast against two or more separate targets. Each resulting spell has the same Range and Target (target category, that is, the actual target may be different) as the original spell, but the power of the effect is divided by the number of resulting split spells. If Sorcerer's Fork expires before the main spell does, the full effect of the spell moves to one of the targets, chosen at random. The precise effect is at storyguide discretion. One casting die is rolled, and the Penetration total is split between the spells. The Sorcerers Fork must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell that is to be split. The split spell has a targeting penalty as for multiple casting (see page 87). If the casting strike the original target.\nNote: The line in italics above was removed in the errata.",

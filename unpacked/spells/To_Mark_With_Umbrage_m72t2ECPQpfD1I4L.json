    "description": "This spell marks every member in a force mundanes, so that, in the confusion of battle, they can tell friend from foe. The mark is a large visual representation of the sigil of the magus. The spell’s creator had a shadowy sigil, so the grogs she marked appeared dark and featureless, giving the spell its name. The spell can be cast on any group of people, and can project any sort of visual mark, so Tremere magi also use it for processions and sport. Any Awareness roll concerning the location of forces has a +3 bonus while this spell is in effect. Examples include selecting areas of the battlefield to target with destructive spells, selecting victims for missile fire, finding groups to rally to when separated from the army in the swirl of battle.\nThis version of the spell is able to mark up to a thousand individuals, in groups within the magus’s Sight. Some younger magi prefer a version of the spell suited for smaller units of grogs. This version is level 25, is effective to Voice range, and can only affect a group of about ten. Others don’t bother because grogs from House covenants usually have a covenant symbol (called a badge) or color on their clothes.",

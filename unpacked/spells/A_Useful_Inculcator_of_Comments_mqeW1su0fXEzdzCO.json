    "description": "This spell allows librarians to add new descriptions to their catalogs, by sliding the letters on a page aside to create the space for the new entry. The spell was originally created by a magus-scribe to assist in glossing books, but is not effective for this purpose in newer works. That’s because the oak-gall “ink” in newer books is really a dye, and to move aside such characters, which are made of dyed parchment, would require an Animal requisite. This limitation can be ignored if magi use true inks, which are suspensions of colored material in fluid, to write their catalogs. This spell assumes an ink made of soot, gum, and vinegar, all of which lie within a single Form. A Dexterity + Finesse roll determines the quality of the text after the magus has relocated it. A result less than 6 indicates that the text has interpolated into and corrupted some other passage.",

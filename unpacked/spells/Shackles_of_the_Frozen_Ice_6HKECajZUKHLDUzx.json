    "description": "Freeze a circular portion of a body of water into solid ice. Anyone wading or swimming in the water is trapped in the ice. Magic Resistance does not prevent the ice from surrounding a character and holding her fast. The area affected by the spell is the same size as a base Individual: a roughly bowl-shaped volume about five paces across and two paces deep at the center.\nSince the ice is magical, it only inflicts cold damage if it penetrates Magic Resistance. Rules for cold damage are given in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 181; the ice created by this spell inflicts a base damage of +1. Characters who are completely encased in ice begin to suffocate (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 180).\nA trapped character may break free of the ice by making a Strength roll. Characters may also chop their way out of the ice using tools or weapons, but this takes time. Magic, including Perdo Aquam or Creo Ignem spells, may be able to free a character instantly. [TABLE]",

    "description": "The target animal (which may be as large as Size +3) becomes angry and must make a Personality roll using a trait such as Angry or Fierce (or perhaps others, at the storyguideâ€™s discretion). If the roll exceeds an Ease Factor of 9, the animal flies into a rage. Once the animal is aroused, it calms down normally. Docile animals such as ewes or oxen calm down almost immediately, while especially aggressive animals like boars or wolves may go on a rampage lasting several minutes. While angry, the animal tries to drive away people or other animals that are nearby, and may attack those who do not flee from it.\nSome magi who follow the School of Vilano use this spell to make animals attack their enemies. In practice, its effects are unpredictable - the animal is just as likely to attack a bystander as the intended target, and there is nothing to prevent it from turning on the caster!",

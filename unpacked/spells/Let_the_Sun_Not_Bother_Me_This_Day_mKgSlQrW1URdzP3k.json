    "description": "This spell cools the caster to a comfortable level, no matter how hot the sun is or how long he stays out in it. As Yestin puts it, “the day becomes as pleasant as a spring afternoon, and loses the wrath of summer’s heat”. The target is still affected by the light of the sun, but its warmth is regulated. All other sources of heat affect the caster naturally.\nThis spell ends either when it reaches its natural duration, when the caster moves into a fully enclosed room (or cavern system or basement), or in the event of an eclipse; it ends when he goes anywhere that sunlight cannot reach him.\nPetalichus the Weaver of Verditius bought a copy of this spell from Yestin when the bard travelled to the Tribunal of Thebes one year. The Verditius claimed to be interested “from a research point of view.” Unknown to Yestin, Petalichus ultimately used the spell in a long- running feud with Solar Magnus of Tytalus, a feud that ended in Stonehenge with the death of Solar Magnus.",

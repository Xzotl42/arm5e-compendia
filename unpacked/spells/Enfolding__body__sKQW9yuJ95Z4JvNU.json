    "description": "<p>2 or 10 points, +10, Vim: When the pious are in danger or torment, the angel may grant them comfort, imparting a moment of peace and mercy. This power renders the target’s soul wholly safe and protected for a short time. While Enfolded the target’s soul (and mind) may not be targeted by any supernatural power of any kind. This power only lasts for a few scant moments, but for the target it is timeless and can seem to stretch to a lifetime. An angel may also Enfold a person’s body (costing 10 Might points), rendering them completely invulnerable to magic, pain, damage, fatigue, wounds, or death, although this power only lasts for a very short period of time (no longer than one combat round). This power is most often used on a member of the faithful who is about to be martyred or suffer terribly.</p>",

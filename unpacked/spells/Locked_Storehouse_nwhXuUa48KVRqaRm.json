    "description": "This spell changes a building and the building’s contents into a large rock of hard igneous stone for a year and a day. The rock is typically significantly smaller than the altered building (having approximately the same mass as the building), and is buried to the depth of the building’s foundation. If there is any material containing animal products in the building (such as leather or wool), then the spell must be cast with an Animal casting requisite or the spell will not function. Over the duration of the spell, the target building and its contents age normally but do not suffer decay in any other respect; Thus no mold or water damage affect the building’s contents, but foodstuffs that have been aged for a year and a day would still be far from appetizing.\nLambert has traded to acquire a casting tablet {Covenants page 89) of the spell Locked Storehouse; he does not know the spell himself. The casting tablet specifies the use of three pawns of Muto vis and six pawns of Terram vis.",

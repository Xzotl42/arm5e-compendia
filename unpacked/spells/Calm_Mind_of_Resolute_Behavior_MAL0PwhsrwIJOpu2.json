    "description": "For the duration of this spell, all emotions are banished from the caster’s mind. This makes the caster unable to feel fear, doubt, hope, or any other emotion. Any effort to manipulate the caster based on his emotions will automatically fail. The caster can make no rolls based on his Personality Traits for the duration of the spell. Despite the temporary absence of emotions, the caster’s goals and priorities remain unchanged and the caster retains recollections of emotions that he has previously felt.\nLambert’s mater believed that this spell was an essential tool for anyone who dealt with the faeries. She believed that casting Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior, to provide Lambert with a moment’s clear reflection before embarking on an activity that might be influenced by the persuasion of charismatic faeries, would save her apprentice from many unwise decisions. Lambert casts Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior when he has an important choice to make and wants to see how he would approach the problem without the complications of his emotions coloring the issue. Lambert finds casting this spell to be quite unpleasant, though, and he greatly fears the possible consequences of miscasting a Perdo Mentem spell on himself.",

    "description": "Using this spell, the magus can shape the growth of a plant over the course of the next year, as if he were properly pruning it, caring for it, and so on. The eventual shape of the plant is determined when the spell is cast and it can be as simple or as complex as the magus desires, although truly complicated designs, such as making a bush grow in the shape of someone’s face, may require a Finesse check. Once the plant reaches the shape and dimensions that the magus wishes, it stops growing until the spell ends or a new spell is cast upon it. Once the spell ends, the plant will then grow normally, but it still retains its magically ‘pruned’ shape, until it grows naturally out of it. Fast grow spells, or other methods used to accelerate the growth of plants, will still work, but until this spell ends the plant will not grow past the design limits originally set. This spell does not change the essential nature of the plant nor give it anything that an exceptionally good gardener couldn’t.",

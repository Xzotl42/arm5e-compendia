    "description": "An enhanced version of Discern the Images of Truth and Falsehood. You can tell whether an image has been created or altered by magic, seeing both the original and false images in the case of alterations. The enhanced sense works by extromission (sending magical species from the eyes). If these encounter any Magic Resistance, they may be blocked. Therefore an area protected by Magic Resistance will appear dark to the magical aspect of the casterâ€™s vision. When cast without Penetration the caster is able to spot areas of Magic Resistance (which would include an invisible magus). To detect an illusion this spell must be at least fifteen levels higher than the effect that generated it. However, use of the Acute Sense mastery ability may still detect an anomaly. If you botch the spell, you mistake illusions for the real thing and reality for illusion. Your discernment is not limited to visual illusions, although you can only tell that a sound is illusory if you are looking at the apparent source.",

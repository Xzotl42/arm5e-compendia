    "description": "The target’s voice is changed so that it is wholly different. This can duplicate the voice of a specific person known to the caster, or a particular accent he has heard before, or simply change the voice to be different than the target’s own. This spell does not allow the target to speak a language that she does not know. An Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 can accurately replicate an accent, and a 9 is needed to duplicate a specific voice. Someone more familiar with the person mimicked may still perpetrate the falsehood. This is also Persephone’s favored spell used to humiliate an opponent she has bested in certamen — she often gives them an unnaturally squeaky or basso profundo voice. A leucrota is a mythical beast that can mimic the voices of men to lure them as prey.",

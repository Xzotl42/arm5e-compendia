    "description": "This spell instantly brings a small orchard to blossom regardless of the season or the conditions. This does not bring the fruit, and a further spell of the same design parameters is needed for this. If that spell is not cast, the elements take their natural toll on the blossom, which may mean that the trees bear no fruit at all.\nCrops grown from seed, such as roots like turnips and radishes, leafy crops such as cabbage or lettuce, and grains like wheat and barley, do not blossom in the same way as trees, and thus variants of this spell are of limited value.\nSuch spells are powerful and, unless they are designed with particular orchards or fields in mind, they give each plant within the target group one Warping Point with each casting.\nAn alternative approach is to put a similar effect into an enchanted device that works on a single tree at a time but with multiple uses per day. This allows a mundane farmer to walk the orchard and bring trees to blossom as he passes. This is another example of how magic can flow down to those who work the land.",

This is the usual melee attack of a phlegethus. Any flammable material catches fire on contact; typically, clothes inflict +10 damage per round on their wearer until extinguished. Any metal coming in contact with the elemental's body for more than a round heats up, causing the effects of <em>Heat of the Searing Forge</em>, but this does not include weapons that attempt to strike them in combat.</span></p><p><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Cr(Re)Ig 30 (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect)</span></p>",

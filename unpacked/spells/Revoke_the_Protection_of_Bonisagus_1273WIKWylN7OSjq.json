    "description": "This spell disrupts the Parma Magica, a specific type of Hermetic magic. This spell must Penetrate the target’s Vim-based Magic Resistance, and it must have a total of (level + 10 + stress die) that is greater than the target’s Parma Magica x 5. The affected magus is still protected by the Magic Resistance provided by his Forms, but must repeat the Parma Magica ritual to restore his full Magic Resistance. The School of Raghallach uses this spell in Wizard War or during a Wizard’s March. Outside of these situations, using this spell against a conscious magus could be construed as the prelude to an attempt to slay a magus; some Tribunals have ruled that the caster forfeits immunity by doing so. Many Tribunals (including Hibernia) have forbidden the creation of enchantments containing this effect that have neither restricted users nor effect expiry, for fear of it getting into the wrong hands.",

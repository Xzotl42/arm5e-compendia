    "description": "An irregular building is reshaped so that a single room in a building becomes perfectly regular. The spell fails unless this can be accommodated by small adjustments to the rest of the building.\nA room so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.\nThe specified room becomes regular: right-angled with straight sides, or perfectly circular (most real buildings are not particularly straight). If this is not possible because the room is highly irregular, then the spell fails. If there is any doubt, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.) .\nThe Structure Target is needed to effect small adjustments to neighboring parts of the building to fit around the new room. (If they were not included in the spell, the structure would fall apart as the room pulled away from the rest.) The remainder of the building need not be regular â€” indeed may be decidedly imperfect given medieval building practices.",

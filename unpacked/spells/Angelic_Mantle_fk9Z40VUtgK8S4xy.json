    "description": "<p>Corpus: Angels use this power to manifest in the mundane world and appear to take on mortal flesh. In reality, this form is entirely formed from their intellect, but appears and acts exactly like real flesh. While in this “material” form, they must follow the mundane world’s natural laws, and so are limited, with Characteristic and Soak scores, and Fatigue and Wound levels. Although angels are genderless, their Mantles normally do have a gender; while in their Mantle, angels may breed, and sire or bear children (although no angel has done so since the flood), although they do not age. If they are “killed” while in their Mantle, they return to their spiritual form, but may if they chose (and have the necessary Might Points) immediately use this power again. An angel’s Mantle may appear as anything.</p>",

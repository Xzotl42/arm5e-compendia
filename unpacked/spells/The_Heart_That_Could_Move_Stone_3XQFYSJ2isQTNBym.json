    "description": "The caster can move stone buildings with incredible force. This usually causes the stone building to collapse, as it is torn from its foundations. Anyone inside takes + 10 damage from the falling structure.\nHowever, if the building is floating (through the Repulsion of Earth effect, for example), then the character can push the building to a new location. Characters inside the building when it is being moved must make Dexterity rolls against an Ease Factor of 6, each round, or lose their footing. Unless special precautions are taken, laboratories inside the building are disrupted by the movement, which ruins any laboratory activities being conducted that season. It takes a season to reorganize a laboratory disrupted in this way.",

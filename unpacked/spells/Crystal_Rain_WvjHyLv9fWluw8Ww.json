    "description": "This spell causes a vast cloud of sharp shards of glass fly to a point in the sky, and then fall to the earth. From a distance, as the light refracts through the plunging glass, it looks like a curious sort of localized rain. The area covered by the falling glass is about 10 paces across, and anyone in (or passing through) the area takes +10 damage. If a wound is caused, blood from the victim falls onto the earth.\nThis is an Aimed spell that consequently bypasses Magic Resistance, and there is a +12 bonus to the Aiming roll to hit due to the number of glass shards (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 86). This Aiming bonus is for a cloud of shards that contains 100 cubic paces of glass. If the cloud of shards contains only 10 cubic paces of glass, the Aiming bonus is reduced to only +6. Remember to count Defense bonuses because of shields.\nThis spell requires that the caster has large collection of sharp glass shards, which need to be mundane in order to bypass Magic Resistance in this way. The shards could be created using a momentary Creo Terram ritual (such as The Shattered Goblet), or they could be acquired from a mundane craftsman, although this is probably more expensive and inconvenient for most magi. As long as the fallen glass shards remain within Sight range of the caster, the same shards can be used to cast the effect again in a subsequent round.",

    "description": "This spell is usually cast when the target deposits a coin into the casterâ€™s hand. The victim immediately loses his memory of having paid. Assuming that he had a legitimate reason for paying in the first place, he then usually reaches for his purse to hand over another coin. Some sneaky covenants have been known to enchant this effect into a toll-gate, for example. Travelers are asked to pay a toll before the gate, then allowed to proceed, whereupon they touch the gate and promptly forget having paid. Upon request, they then pay again, after the gate. The income from a toll station can thus be doubled.",

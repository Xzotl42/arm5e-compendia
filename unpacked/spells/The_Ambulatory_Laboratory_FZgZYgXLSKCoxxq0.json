    "description": "This spell precisely transports all the movable contents of a chamber into another room to which the caster has an Arcane Connection, leaving their configuration and relative positions intact. Some casting requisites are usually required, depending on the composition of the labâ€™s outfittings; a Herbam requisite is required to move wooden furniture, an Aquam requisite is required to move liquids, and so on. The destination room must be at least as large as the occupied part of the current room, although it can be a different shape. Magi quite often utilize this effect in order to avoid the tiresome (and expensive) practicalities of moving their sanctum by more mundane means. When this spell is cast on a lab, make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the precision with which the contents are rearranged in the new chamber. The base Ease Factor is 9 + (3 x Refinement). Add three if the lab is Highly Organized; subtract three if it is Disorganized. Also add three if the shapes of the old and new chambers do not match, or six if they are radically different. If this roll fails, the Disorganized Flaw is gained, or the Highly Organized Virtue is lost. If the roll botches, the Hidden Defect Flaw is gained instead.\nA version of this spell with Arcane Connection Range is also believed to exist; with this more powerful variant a magus may summon the contents of a remote lab into the chamber he occupies. It is not unheard of for a nefarious magus to steal an entire lab in this fashion!",

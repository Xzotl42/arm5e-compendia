    "description": "This momentary ritual opens a temple shell to habitation by Mercury. This creates a level 1 Magic aura within the temple precinct (which may be then swamped by a larger aura of a different sort). As this is a momentary Creo ritual, once the ritual has been cast the aura remains and cannot be dispelled. If the temple already has a Magic aura the existing aura is not increased by the casting of this spell.\nAnother effect of this spell is that the temple has the magical property that it is consecrated to Mercury, which is important for some of the other recovered Mercurian rituals. The consecration can be detected by Hermetic Intellego Vim magic (as an effect of eleventh magnitude) and this effect can also be dispelled with Hermetic Perdo Vim (even though the aura itself cannot be dispelled). If the consecration is dispelled the ritual can be cast again to restore this property.\nThe final effect of this spell is that any characters with Faith Points whom are within the Structure at the time of casting (including the caster) lose 1 Faith Point. This Faith Point may be regained in the usual ways.\nThe temple shell must be built to the same plan as the ruined temple (just the temple itself, in the center of the town). The temple can be a different size to this exemplar temple, however. The ruined temple is not currently consecrated.",

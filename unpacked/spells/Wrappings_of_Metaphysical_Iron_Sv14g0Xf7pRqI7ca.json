    "description": "This spell wards an object from being touched or manipulated by faeries or faerie magic. Faeries with Might greater than the spell’s level are not restrained by this spell, nor are faeries that resist the spell’s Penetration.\nLambert’s version of this spell was developed from laboratory notes made by a Merinita magus with the virtue of Spell Potency (The Mysteries Revised Edition page 31 or Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults page 6) concerning faeries. Lambert is unable to cast this spell unless he wraps an iron chain around the protected item at the time of the casting. Due to the influence of the iron chain, this spell is cast with a Potency Bonus of +7. Lambert finds that faeries rarely confront him about his use of this spell when he casts it on goods that he brings into their lands, but they become exceedingly displeased by the spell when it is used upon any item that is native to their home.",

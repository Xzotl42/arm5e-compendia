    "description": "As this spell is cast, a whipping wind arises and patches of mist begin to roll across the landscape. Sometimes, a patch of mist suddenly envelops a person for a few seconds, during which time the victim cannot move. When the mist blows away, continuing its course, the person is left transformed into a random creature. Roll a simple die to determine the result: [TABLE] .\nOn a roll of 10, the storyguide picks a creature; be cruel. People transformed retain their human minds, but inherit all the passions and instincts of their new forms. The mist covers the target area, which must be in sight when you cast the spell. The mists affect the area until sunrise or sunset, and transform anyone who remains in the area during that time. For important characters, roll a simple die when the spell is cast and every half hour afterwards, and on a roll lower than the number of rolls made so far the mists envelope and transform them at some point in the next half hour. The transformations last a Year.",

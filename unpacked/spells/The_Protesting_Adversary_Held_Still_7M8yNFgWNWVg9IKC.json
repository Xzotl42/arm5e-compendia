    "description": "The affected target is held fast and still for as long as the caster concentrates. Being held means that the target is unable to move his body, including his limbs, fingers, eyes, and lips. A magus who tries to cast spells while under the effect of this spell is likely to be subject to a penalty to his casting total, unless the intended magical effect does not require words and gestures (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 83).\nIn Tolidesâ€™ version of this spell, small ripples of darkness quiver over the body of the target that seem to function as ropes, holding his victim in place.",

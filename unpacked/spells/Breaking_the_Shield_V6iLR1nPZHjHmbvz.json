    "description": "This spell is designed to permanently cancel an existing Aegis of the Hearth ritual with a level less than 30 (i.e. the level of this spell +1 magnitude) + a Stress Die, bringing its magical protection to an abrupt end.\nAs this spell is cast against an Aegis, the effect must first penetrate the level of that Aegis. This version of the spell has been designed to tear down at least a sixth magnitude Aegis, and so must penetrate a resistance of at least 30. To help with this feat, Al-’Aqrab has taught versions of the Wizards Communion spell to the other magi in his new covenant, which helps them to cast their spells and Rituals at sufficiently high level and penetration.\nCasting this spell requires that AUAqrab be within sight of the target’s boundary, though of course the Aegis itself does not need to be made visible.",

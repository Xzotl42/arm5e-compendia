    "description": "As the caster walks, this spell shifts the earth underfoot allowing him to travel over rutted paths and uneven roads as though they were flat and even. The earth returns to its prior position after the target of the spell has passed. The spell ends when the caster comes to a stop, such as to rest, or crosses terrain unaffected by this spell, such as a wooden bridge or a ford.\nThis spell has little effect on soft or muddy paths, as the earth must still be able to bear the targetâ€™s weight. The spell is potent enough to move stones and cobbles in the road.\nA traveler using this spell does not suffer undue delay for traveling over poor roads. Traveling at speed to cover more ground in the day still costs the stated Long-Term Fatigue level. City & Guild, page 85, provides more detail on travel speeds. Targets affected by this spell use speeds close to the top end of the applicable travel speeds.",

    "description": "This ritual creates a metal dagger. The blade contains cleverly designed gutters that feed into a reservoir in the hilt. This means that if anyone is injured by the dagger (takes a Wound), then a sample of their blood is collected in the dagger’s hilt. A version of this ritual could be created with as a spell with a duration (such as Sun) for use in emergency circumstances. However, the dagger created with the ritual is not magical, so it does not need to Penetrate Magic Resistance to harm a target (which a spell with a non-Momentary duration would need to do).\nThe dagger can be used as either a thrown or melee weapon. It is less useful in Defense than a normal dagger, and less aerodynamic than a throwing knife. In both cases, this is because The Thirsty Dagger is oddly weighted due to the blood reservoir. The dagger’s weapon characteristics are: .\nAbility: Brawl, Init: +0, Atk: +2, Dfn: -1, Dam: +3, Str: -1, Load: 0 .\nAbility: Thrown, Init: -1, Atk: 0, Dfn: -1, Dam: +2, Str: -1, Load: 0",

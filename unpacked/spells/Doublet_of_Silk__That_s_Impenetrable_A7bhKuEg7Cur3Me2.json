    "description": "As Doublet of Impenetrable Silk, but experimentation has resulted in a minor side effect. The clothing affected is changed into actual silk, as well as gaining the normal benefits of the spell.\nChange an item made of animal material — silk, wool, or leather — so it cannot be cut or penetrated by weapons. A simple cloth doublet becomes the equivalent of armor with no Load and a 4-3 Soak bonus. Armor made of quilted material or any kind of leather improves its Protection by an additional 4-3. The magic does not make the armor better at absorbing shock, so this 4-3 bonus is the limit that can be bestowed without changing the material into something completely different. At the storyguide’s option, the bonus given by this spell may not apply against strictly blunt weapons like clubs and staves.",

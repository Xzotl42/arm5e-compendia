    "description": "The target of this spell can detect desire and interest as a scent given off by any mind in the targetâ€™s vicinity. The more powerful the emotion of desire felt by a person, the stronger a smell that the target of Scent of Loose Purses will detect from them.\nLambert frequently casts this spell on his family and people in his employ to help them learn to read the emotions of people with whom they come in contact. Oftentimes Lambert will have someone who does not have Scent of Loose Purses cast upon her give her impressions of people to someone who does, so that they both learn to perceive cues without the aid of magic.",

    "description": "Move a stone through the air as fast as a bird flies. When the caster stops concentrating, the stone immediately falls to the ground.\nThe spell’s name suggests one of its common applications: dropping a heavy rock onto someone. Because the stone falls naturally, such an attack is not subject to Magic Resistance. Instead, an aiming roll is required to hit the intended target (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 86). Attacking with this spell normally takes two rounds: one to move the stone over the target, and another to aim and release it.\nDamage inflicted depends mainly on the size of the stone: +5 for a stone the size of a man’s fist, +10 for a typical building- stone, up to +21 for a large boulder (see also the Impact Table on page 181 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition). Particularly large stones can damage structures as well as creatures.\nThe main limitation on this spell’s combat effectiveness is the availability of large stones. Vilano himself once lamented that there was never a good rock around when he needed one!",

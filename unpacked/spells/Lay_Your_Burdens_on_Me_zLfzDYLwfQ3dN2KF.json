    "description": "This spell brings the target’s secrets bubbling to the top of his consciousness, playing on his mind and making him more inclined to disclose them.\nFor the purposes of this spell, secrets are those things that gnaw at the target’s conscience in the face of questioning — those things that the target would normally strive to keep hidden because of guilt or shame or fear. Secrets kept for noble reasons are not affected by this spell, which was a conscious design decision made by Yestin. This spell does not make the target susceptible to questioning on other matters, and so cannot be used to assist directed interrogation.\nAt the end of the spell’s duration, the target must make a personality roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the target succeeds, she maintains control over her secret and keeps it hidden. The troupe should agree which Personality trait the target uses in the roll.\nFor each subsequent day that the spell is cast on the target, the Ease Factor increases by 1. Virtues and Flaws may modify the roll and/or the Ease Factor, with the Storyguide’s agreement.\nIf the personality check fails, the target falls prey to his conscience and seeks someone to confide in. That person may not necessarily be the caster of the spell, and will most likely be someone the target feels he can trust. The Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact on this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects of human life. If the target spends time in the Dominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the truth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the target’s roll. The aura’s Temper (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave, Wise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura’s effect by 1.\nIf the target spends the duration of the spell within an Infernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura reinforces the target’s resolve to keep the secret. The level of the aura is added to the target’s roll. The Storyguide may impose a further bonus to the roll based on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal aura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13).\nYestin invented this spell as a means to more easily solve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him into; mysteries often solved by knowing what those involved wished to hide.",

    "description": "One way of determining the rightful heir to an inheritance is to defer to someone or something that already knows the answer. The magic realm is replete with spirits representing every aspect of Godâ€™s creation including, conceivably, spirits of a given bloodline.\nMagical spirits of blood can be summoned through the form of Corpus using a base 15 effect as explained in The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 28. This is something that all magi can do and is not reliant on any Mystery initiations.\nThe caster often prepares a warding circle and then summons the target spirit into that circle. The Arcane Connection used must intimately relate to the target bloodline; a crown for a royal line, a sword passed from father to son, earth from a family estate, and so on. Once summoned, the spirit can be questioned or commanded as normal and if it is powerful enough it should have knowledge of the true heir to the line.\nShould the magus wish it, he may also be able to command other information from the spirit concerning those who share its blood.",

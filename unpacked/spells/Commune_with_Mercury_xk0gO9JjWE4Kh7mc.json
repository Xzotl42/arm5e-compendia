    "description": "This ritual, cast within a consecrated temple of Mercury, allows the character to communicate in their mind with the god Mercury; or at least someone claiming that he is. Whether the god has anything useful to say is up to the troupe.\nThe god exists somewhere in the Magic realm and seemingly has no knowledge of Mythic Europe since the adoption of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine in 313 AD, and has only a hazy understanding of Mythic Europe under the pagan Roman Empire. The god is conscious and if contacted several times he remembers the earlier contacts, although he seems to experience the passage of time differently from the characters. Depending on the needs of your saga, the god could have an agenda, such as the re-establishment of a pagan empire or the recovery of artifacts. Alternatively, the god may not care much at all about the world and activities of the player characters.\nNote that this ritual does not need to Penetrate to have an effect.",

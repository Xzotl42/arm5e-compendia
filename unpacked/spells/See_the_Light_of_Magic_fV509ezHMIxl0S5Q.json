    "description": "The caster can detect all active magical effects. Spells appear as glowing lights with a brightness proportional to their magnitude. This spell provides sufficient information to target the sensed magical effects, but the magus does not receive any information about the magical effects, and therefore he does not know which effect is which, if he is looking for a particular one. However, if the caster has used this spell previously, he can identify the presence of a new effect. If there is a large number of effects present, the troupe may rule that a Perception + Awareness roll is required to notice this detail — the Ease Factor should be modified by the total number of effects the caster can perceive and the magnitude of the new effect (relative to the other effects). There may be a large number of magical effects active within the vicinity of the magus — Parma Magica, longevity rituals, Aegis of the Hearth, familiar bonds, enchanted items, and of course, any active spells will all be detected. Active, non-Hermetic, but magical, effects are also detected.",

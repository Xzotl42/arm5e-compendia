    "description": "This spell creates a complete memory in the mind of the target. The target retains this memory until the duration of the spell expires. After the spell expires, the target may still recall those times when he dwelt on the memory. This spell-induced memory itself is false and may be discovered as such with an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (in the same manner as a memory created by the spell Memory of the Distant Dream).\nLambert frequently uses this spell for communication with distant associates (but not with magi who are, as a nearly universal rule, uncomfortable leaving Arcane Connections with others). To draw attention to the information that he wants to convey, Lambert typically creates memories for the targetâ€™s very recent past that are clearly impossible, such as a memory of the target and a talking statue having had a long conversation on a snowy mountaintop within the last ten minutes.\nWhile this spell only takes a moment to cast, the magus needs to have a clear understanding of the memory that he wants to create in his own mind before creating it in the mind of the target. If the magus is not prepared, he cannot create a complex memory lasting more than a moment, or a longer memory that contains any great detail and is not repetitive. The preparation of any complex memory takes at least as long for the magus to create as the elapsed time of the memory that is created. Lambert specifically designed Missive of Memory to not Warp his second daughter.",

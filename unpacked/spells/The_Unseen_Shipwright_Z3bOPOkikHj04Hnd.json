    "description": "The magus selects a pile of wood and formed iron fixtures, and the spell cuts, carves, and joins the wood into the hull of a target ship, repairing splits and holes under the magusâ€™ direction. The worst damage is repaired first so that the vessel is always left seaworthy and the repairs are practically seamless.\nA Perception + Finesse roll is required against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide. The table on Covenants, page 49, is a useful guide, but a rule of thumb is that repairing a small leak or a splintered rudder is a task of average difficulty taking no more than a day for an Ease Factor of 12, while refloating a wrecked ship is almost impossible, with an Ease Factor of at least 27 (plus any modifiers that the storyguide imposes based on how long it might take a mundane shipwright to refloat the vessel). The magus must have appropriate materials to hand in order to make repairs.",

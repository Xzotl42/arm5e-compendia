    "secrets": "<p><strong>Magic resistance</strong>: 15 (Divine)</p><p>Claude is Geoffroi's steward, a trusted retainer tasked with many of Geoffroi's affairs. The players are often as likely to encounter Claude as they are to encounter Geoffroi himself.</p><p>Claude de Fecamp was schooled at a Benedictine monastery, but has been part of Geoffroi's household for the last sixyears. His first year with the baron was a troubled time, and Claude resented both his master's wealth and his own subservient position. He angered many, treated others with contempt and scant regard, and made few friends. One evening he was set upon by persons unknown. He was severely beaten and would have been killed but for Divine intervention. An angel enfolded him in its light and confronted Claude with the mistakes that had brought him so low. This event changed Claude's life forever. He reaffirmed his loyalty to Geoffroi, put aside his wayward habits, and dedicated himself to his duties. And in return, the angel promised that Claude would be protected from the world so long as he remained true. Those in Geoffroi's household now barely remember Claude as he was and only pay respect to the man he has become: loyal and temperate.* Claude's soak score includes the +5 bonus granted by his guardian angel. This same guardian angel also grants Claude a magic resistance of +15 aligned with the Divine while he acts in accordance with God's ineffable will.* A mundane astrologer and philosopher skilled in the creation of astrological inceptions who wants to learn true magic. * A blind beggar cursed with prophetic visions that haunt his dreams. What he would give for one sight to be exchanged for another. * A young boy who sees ghosts, and the mother who spirited him away from their frightened village. * A faerie-touched armorer with exceptional skill, who needs somewhere to work, funds to refine his workshop, and someone to deal with the faerie that continually tries to steal back its tools.</p><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A simple habit in the style of a monk,wooden crucifix,pouch of money usually filled with sufficient for most expenses.</p>",

        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education. Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, he can hear and converse with you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your guardian angel can also help in two practical ways. First, he can grant you a +5 bonus to Soak. Second, he can grant you a Magic Resistance of 15. This Magic Resistance is not compatible with a magus’s Parma Magica, or Magic Resistance from most other sources, but it does add to the Magic Resistance resulting from Faith Points (see page @@). The angel only grants you these bonuses if you are acting in accordance with God’s will.</p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This character doesn’t feel strongly for or against anything and lacks the unique traits most people have to make them really stand out. Consequently, all Personality Traits must be between +1 and –1. When making personality rolls, treat any roll above 6 as merely 6. The character may have no other Personality Flaws or Virtues or Flaws that grant Personality Traits. Depending on the personality of the observer, he may seem a complete pushover with no opinion of his own, insensitive because he rarely shows strong emotion, or simply lacking in initiative to those seeking leadership and guidance. These elements result in a –1 or worse (at the storyguide’s discretion) modifier in most social situations for obviously being a cold fish. Finally, he will never be known for his great loyalty or pious nature, and will have a hard time winning respect or getting promoted. His lack of enthusiasm for the Church in particular might be viewed as a lack of faith. On the plus side, he might occasionally be seen in a positive light since he never disagrees strongly.</p></div>",

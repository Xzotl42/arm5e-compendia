This Ability should be one that is important to the character, or the troupe may veto the choice of this Flaw. When she fails, she does so dramatically. Whenever she rolls a zero when using the Ability, that zero is treated as a botch. She may need to roll extra botch dice depending on the circumstances, but she always suffer the effects of at least a single botch. This Flaw may be taken more than once; each time, it applies to a different Ability.</span></p>",

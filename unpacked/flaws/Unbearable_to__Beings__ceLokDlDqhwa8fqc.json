These last two include characters associated with the Divine or the Infernal realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Divine or Infernal Might.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">These beings are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by the character’s presence. She suffers an additional –3 penalty on all social interactions with them, which adds to the –3 penalty normally associated with The Gift. Only characters with The Gift or Magical Air may take this Flaw, and it cannot be combined with the Blatant Gift.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Unbearable to more than one kind of being should take the Blatant Gift instead.</p></div>",

In game terms, the character has a –3 penalty to all rolls when traveling through any other sort of environment (it is assumed that once the character has time to recover from the journey, she will find some reminder of her natural environment to help her rest). For example, a character who is Anchored to the Sea would suffer the penalty when traveling overland, but once settled can easily comfort herself — with the sound of the sea heard in a seashell, perhaps.</span></p>",

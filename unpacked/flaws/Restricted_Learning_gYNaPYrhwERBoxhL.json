    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character is incapable of learning new things without assistance. Pick five Abilities at character creation; you can only apply experience points to these Abilities. The character cannot learn any new Abilities on her own; she must receive experience points from Teaching or Training to develop a new Ability or to improve one that is not part of the initial five. Furthermore, she cannot use an Ability with no score, even if it can normally be used untrained. Any Supernatural Abilities from Virtues she possesses are added to the list of Abilities to which she can apply experience points. All mundane animals are required to take this Flaw. A character with Intelligence rather than Cunning is not a mundane animal for these purposes.</p></div>",

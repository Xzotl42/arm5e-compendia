    "description": "<p>You are a chirurgeon by trade, but have never received a wide grounding in the subject; rather your training has focused on only a single aspect of Chirurgy. Pick a type of surgery as your specialization in that Ability (couching cataracts, removal of stones, bone-setting, etc.). When performing this type of surgery, you get the usual +1 bonus to your roll, but when trying to employ any other application of Chirurgy, you must halve your score in Chirurgy due to your inexperience. It is likely that you travel to get enough clientele for your practice, but can usually earn a good living.</p>",

You catch no oneâ€™s eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person. You cannot gain a positive Reputation in any community, and this Flaw is incompatible with any Virtue that gives you such a Reputation.</p>",

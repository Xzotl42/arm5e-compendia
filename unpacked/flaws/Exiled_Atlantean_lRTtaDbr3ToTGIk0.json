This exile is enforced by the very nature of the magic regio to which the Atlanteans are native, so there is no authority figure to which she may appeal, or any obvious method of returning to favor. The exile applies even if the Atlantean left her native magic regio involuntarily. More details about the Atlanteans can be found in <em>Realms of Power: Magic,</em> page 90.</p>",

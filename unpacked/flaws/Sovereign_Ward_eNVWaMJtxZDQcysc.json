    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a taboo is selected as a major flaw, the faerie may not harm a person or thing that is defended by the ward. “Harm” is defined very broadly in the faerie’s glamour. A faerie that is vulnerable to religious symbols, for example, can not work around the symbol by putting mundane poison in the food of the wearer, or burning his house down around him. The person is completely safe from the faerie. The faerie must attempt to flee the ward, and its body is destroyed instantly by the ward’s touch.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">More often than not, this character is unable to sleep soundly during the night. The resulting deprivation means that he is likely to nod off in periods of quiet and boredom. When the character is alone, comfortable, bored, or otherwise at risk of falling asleep, he needs to make a suitable Personality roll to avoid nodding off. Loyal, Reliable, and Lazy (for a penalty in the last case) are all appropriate. The characterâ€™s current Fatigue penalty applies to the roll.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Regardless of whether he manages to stay awake, the following night you must make a stress roll (no botch) against an Ease Factor of 6 to see if the character sleeps well. Every night he has slept poorly, he loses a Long Term Fatigue Level. Continue this until he sleeps soundly for a whole night. Once he has lost 3 Long Term Fatigue Levels, he automatically sleeps through the night, due to sheer exhaustion. This Flaw is not compatible with the Night Ter- rors Flaw.</p></div>",

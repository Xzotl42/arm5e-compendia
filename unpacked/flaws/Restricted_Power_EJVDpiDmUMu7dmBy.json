    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This Flaw limits the use of a supernatural power that can normally be used at will, such as those granted by the Focus Power, Greater Power, Lesser Power, Personal Power, and Ritual Power Virtues. The character must perform some special ceremony to activate it, such as drawing symbols on the ground or gesturing and chanting like a magus, or else the power only functions on a limited class of targets (such as men, wolves, sounds, or sand) or in specific circumstances (like at night, under water, when touching iron, or after singing a song). This Flaw may be taken once for each power the character possesses.</p></div>",

He has five Warping Points and a Warping Score of 1, including a Minor Flaw (which is not balanced by a Virtue) that somehow reflects the source of the Warping. His encounters allow you to spend experience points on Magic Lore during character creation. A magus may take this Flaw to represent Warping gained before his apprenticeship. With the permission of the troupe, this Flaw may be modified to represent Warping from other Realms.</p></div>",

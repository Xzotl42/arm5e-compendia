You begin with at least three Warping points, plus one Warping point for every year that has passed since you were resurrected, and you automatically receive another Warping point every year you continue living. You also have a level 4 reputation in the area where the miracle occurred. You do not remember what happened to you while you were dead, although you may have virtuous impulses that you cannot explain.</p></div>",

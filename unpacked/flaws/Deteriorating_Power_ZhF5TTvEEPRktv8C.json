    "description": "<p>Like the Variable Powers Virtue, this Flaw reduces the effectiveness of one of the character’s powers (Greater, Lesser, or Ritual) over time. This penalty is linked to either the character’s (age / 10), (Might Score – Might Pool / 5), or Warping Score. For example, a magic character with Deteriorating Powers linked to age and an age of 25 would have one of his powers reduced by 3 magnitudes.</p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character lives according to a strict religious rule, which leaves little time for other activities. The character must spend one of his free seasons on the seasonal activity of worship. This is particularly suitable for monk and canon characters, but it is not compulsory. The Regular Flaw is compatible with Wealthy and Poor, but a Poor Regular character effectively has no free seasons and may be unsuitable as a player character. Magi can be Regular.</p></div>",

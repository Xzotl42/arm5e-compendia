    "description": "<p>The character is the Animal Companion of another character (either a player character or a storyguide character) and therefore has little control over his own life. He is largely dependent on his master for food and shelter, and has an additional Personality Trait of “Loyal to Master” which represents this bond. Among people who know his master, the character is treated better than he would be, perhaps as that person’s pet or bodyguard. Others most likely treat him as a brute or a dumb beast.</p>",

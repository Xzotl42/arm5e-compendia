    "description": "<p>You do not follow the teachings of the Church, and have never been baptized. This tends to upset those in authority in Mythic Europe and frighten common people who learn of it. You do not observe Christian holidays, and you try to avoid churchmen and the Dominion. You cannot pretend to go along with society, however, because you believe that it would displease your gods and incur their wrath â€” you might suffer grave supernatural consequences if you take Communion or appear to worship gods other than your own. You may begin with Magic Lore or Faerie Lore, depending on the specifics of your faith. (This is not a Flaw in areas of Mythic Europe with substantial pagan populations, but by 1220 the only such areas are in parts of the Novgorod Tribunal. It may also be a Minor Flaw for grogs who live at a covenant with a substantial pagan population that is an accepted and open part of the covenant community.)</p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">The character suffers from feelings of loneliness, boredom, and depression if he does not expose himself to new experiences. He can stave off the boredom for a while, but if he remains in one place for more than a season, he suffers a –1 penalty to all rolls and totals until he experiences a change in scene. This penalty rises to –3 after a year of boredom. This character is probably the first to volunteer for a mission beyond the covenant gates, and may even spend part of each year in a different location such as the nearby wood. This Flaw might seem to make the character unsuitable for life at a covenant, so you should decide what it is at the covenant that means he keeps coming back. Perhaps it is the love of his life, the camaraderie, or perhaps just the feeling that he fits in here.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p>The character occasionally suffers convulsions and blackouts. Convulsions occur randomly and infrequently; for any given event, the storyguide should secretly roll a stress die, and if the result is 9 or more then a convulsion will occur at some point during that event, as chosen by the storyguide. This spasm causes random movements and hallucinations, leaving the character temporarily Incapacitated. She collapses to the ground and twitches, and you can make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 every round; success means that the convulsion ends, although the character is reduced to the Dazed Fatigue level following a fit. The Falling Evil is usually caused by possession by demons (<em>Art & Academe</em>, page 48), but that form of the illness is usually temporary in nature. The character does not seem to have a disease, and cannot naturally recover from this affliction. It may be that it stems from a different source. In Ancient Greece and Rome, it was called the “divine illness,” as it was believed that the gods spoke to those who had such fits.</p>",

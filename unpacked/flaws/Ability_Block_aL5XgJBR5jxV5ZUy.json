A profound inability to master logic would rule out Artes Liberales, Philosophiae, any Law, Medicine, and Theology. Alternatively, you might be unable to learn any languages other than your native tongue. It must be possible for your character to learn the abilities in question in the absence of this Flaw, but she need have no intention of doing so. You may only take this Flaw once.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This is the Flaw for “the boy who cried wolf,” and probably results from Infernal influence. The character has three extra botch dice when using Guile. More importantly, the character is rarely believed, even when he is being honest. He must make a Communication + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to be believed when he tells the truth at important moments. For example, if the character is returning from a scouting mission, and you fail his Guile roll when he reports back, the maga may assume that he has been deficient in his duties; perhaps she thinks that he never went scouting at all, but instead went to the nearest town to entertain himself. This character may prefer the company of animals to that of people, as they do not respond to subterfuge.</p>",

You can still understand languages perfectly well, and may learn to read and write if you have an appropriate Virtue. Note that magi with this Flaw get a â€“10 penalty to all spellcasting, although this may be offset by taking the Quiet Magic Virtue (page @@). A magus with this Flaw can be assumed to be able to make sounds, which are sufficient to allow normal use of the Voice Range.</p>",

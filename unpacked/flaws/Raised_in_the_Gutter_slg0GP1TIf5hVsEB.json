    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This character was raised on the margins of society. She is able to use her social abilities normally with those of the lower and middle classes, but doesn’t know how to act among her “betters.” When using Charm or Guile, it is obvious that she’s from the bad part of town, and this makes convincing people to do what she wants harder (–3 on rolls). She can use Etiquette normally if she’s holding her social place (which means staying silent and doing exactly what she’s told) but suffers a –3 penalty if she tries to go beyond this.</p></div>",

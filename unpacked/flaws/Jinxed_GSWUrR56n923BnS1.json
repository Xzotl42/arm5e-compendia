    "description": "<p>The character is a magnet for any bad luck. He is not personally the cause of the bad luck, and so need not roll any extra botch dice or suffer any penalty to die rolls. However, whenever chance determines who will be affected by misfortune, the odds are biased against him to be the one affected. For example, if it has been determined that a rope used for climbing will break, it is more likely to do so when the jinxed character makes the climb. If determining when the bandits will attack the camp at night, it is more likely to happen right at the moment when the character is relieving himself. If the storyguide is rolling dice to determine the target of a random event, a jinxed character should be affected half of the time, and his comrades between them the other half. His bad luck does not tend to spill over onto others; in fact, other characters may prefer to keep him around to deflect any bad luck from themselves.</p>",

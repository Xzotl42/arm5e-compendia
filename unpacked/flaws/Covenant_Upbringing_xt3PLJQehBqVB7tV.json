You might have very strange religious beliefs, and you certainly find medieval social and political structures very odd. You may take Latin at character creation, and are likely to have a score in Order of Hermes Lore. While Latin cannot be your native language, you may speak a language closely related to Latin that is spoken only at your home covenant.</p>",

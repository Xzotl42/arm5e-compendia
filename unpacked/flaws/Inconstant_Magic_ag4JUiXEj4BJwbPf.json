    "description": "<p>The character’s magic is easily distracted, and it stutters and starts. Spells that require his guidance (e.g. concentration, or aimed spells) after being cast are not immediately responsive, as if the character must focus the spell’s attention, and spells that are triggered by a condition (such as <em>Waiting Spells </em>or enchanted devices) take about two minutes to activate, as if the magic had wandered off when the caster was not watching it carefully. Any magic items he creates with constant effects are interrupted at sunrise and sunset; the magic is not seamless. The character suffers a –3 penalty to all Finesse rolls.</p>",

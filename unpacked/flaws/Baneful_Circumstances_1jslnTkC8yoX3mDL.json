At these times, the character cannot recover Fatigue, heal wounds, or recover Might, and if at the end of the year the character has spent more than half of his time subject to these conditions, he must make an additional Aging roll even if he is normally immune to aging because of a Longevity Ritual or Might Score.</p>",

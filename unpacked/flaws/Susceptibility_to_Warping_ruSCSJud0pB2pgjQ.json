This means that if he gains a single Warping Point from each Realm in a year, he gains four additional Warping Points, one from each Realm, at the end of that year.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">These additional points do not contribute to Wizard’s Twilight or to other events caused by the acquisition of Warping Points as they accrete slowly over the course of the year.</p></div>",

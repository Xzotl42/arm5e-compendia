    "description": "<p>The character seeks to undermine religion whenever possible, and generally tries to avoid the Dominion. He might sin in public, teach misinformation about the tenets of the faith, or show obvious disdain for holy things. He is not necessarily an infernalist; it could be that he simply despises organized religion, dislikes the Divine realm, or does not believe in God. He might even be persuaded to attend services, though he does not take any of it seriously and is likely to disrupt the ceremony with his discomfort and ignorance.</p>",

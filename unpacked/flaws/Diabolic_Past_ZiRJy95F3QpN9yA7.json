Perhaps your parents were diabolists, although you were not, or maybe you joined a cult but soon repented and fled. Your former associates still take an interest in your activities and whereabouts. Unfortunately. You may purchase the Ability Infernal Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Abilities.</p>",

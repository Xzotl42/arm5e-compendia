    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Some powerful magical creature has saved the character from death or granted a similar boon, and in return the character has been set a task. Possible tasks include: preaching a message, operating a lighthouse, or preventing hunting in a certain area. Usually the task is either difficult or time-consuming, and while it remains incomplete the character has the Minor Personality Flaw: Prohibition, but this does not count toward the characterâ€™s total number of Virtues and Flaws. The Prohibition means that if the character does not spend at least one complete season every year working toward his assigned task, a curse afflicts him. Possible curses include: a magical compulsion to return to the land where the character must explain himself to his master, turning into an animal, or acquiring a Supernatural Flaw.</p></div>",

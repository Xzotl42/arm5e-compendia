    "description": "<p>Wherever he stays, unpleasant rumors and ill-favored stories about this character begin to spread within a short time. This can be due to bad luck, or it could be something supernatural, like a curse. The slander is centered on one specific section of mundane society — the nobility, the church, guilds, peasants — and it seriously hampers his working life. After staying one season in an area, he gains a bad Reputation at level 1, usually a Local Reputation. He gains one point toward raising the Reputation in each further season, or more if he is involved in disturbing or strange events. Truly remarkable deeds can halt the increase for one season, but they will be forgotten come next season. At a covenant, people are used to strange things and deviant behavior. The Reputation is gained and increases in intervals of years rather than seasons, giving the poor victim more time before he becomes completely shunned. If the character leaves an area, the Reputation stops increasing, and may even fall, at the troupe’s discretion.</p>",

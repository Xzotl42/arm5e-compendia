    "description": "<p><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Perhaps due to his beast blood or feral upbringing, the character has the strong natural smell of a wild animal. Humans tend to avoid being too close to him, and may be on edge in his vicinity without knowing why. He may well spook domesticated animals if he surprises them. He suffers a â€“1 penalty to social interactions (which stacks with the penalties imposed by The Gift, if he has it), and develops a negative Reputation of Unclean at level 2. However, if he has Initiated the Sensory Magic Mystery (described in <em>Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults,</em> page 27), any spells he casts with a Scent Target have twice their normal area of effect.</span></p>",

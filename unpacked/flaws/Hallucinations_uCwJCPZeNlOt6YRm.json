    "description": "<p>The character is afflicted by vivid hallucinations which seem to be true visions, but rather than coming from a higher power, they are figments of her imagination and fantasy. She finds these visions particularly troublesome, and seeks meaning in them where there is none to be had. Coincidence might mean that some part of her hallucinations comes to pass, which only furthers her belief that there is meaning within them. If the character also has the Visions Flaw, then some of her visions are true, but most of them are meaningless jumbles of nonsense generated from within her mind.</p>",

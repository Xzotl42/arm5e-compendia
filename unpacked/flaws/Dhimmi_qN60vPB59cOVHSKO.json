If you are adult and male, you must pay the <em>jizya</em> head tax, and all <em>dhimmis</em> must abide by certain social restrictions (described in the sourcebooks for these areas of Mythic Europe â€” see <em>Realms of Power: The Divine, The Cradle and the Crescent, Between Sand and Sea,</em> and <em>Lands of the Nile</em>), in return for which they receive tolerance and protection from the Muslim authorities. The actual amount a <em>dhimmi</em> has to pay in <em>jizya</em> varies, but rarely exceeds a <em>dinar</em> (a gold coin) per year.</span></p>",

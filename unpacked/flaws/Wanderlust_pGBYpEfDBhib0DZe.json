The character can only spend two (nonconsecutive) seasons each year in the same area, and must spend the intervening seasons traveling to different locales â€” places he has never been. If for some reason he cannot travel, he will become very uncomfortable; this discomfort should cause stories in the same way as the travel would.</p>",

The character cannot control this process, but may make Intelligence + Enigmatic Wisdom rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 to tell those so afflicted what form of spiritual purification they must undergo for the stigma to disappear. Characters who are stigmatized may have a hostile reaction if they realize the source of the stigmata. This Flaw is normally found among magi of House Criamon, and magi of that House would be interested in any other character who manifested it.</p></div>",

The character must live in a supernatural aura of 5 or greater to remain healthy; if it spends most of a season outside such an aura, make a Stamina Roll against an Ease Factor of (9 â€“ Size). If you fail the roll, the character sustains a Heavy wound, unless the previous season it also failed such a roll, in which case it sustains an Incapacitating wound instead. Choose the realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) to which the character is bound when you take the Flaw.</span></p>",

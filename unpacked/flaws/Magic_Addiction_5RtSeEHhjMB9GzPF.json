    "description": "<p>You crave the rush of casting and holding power over magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against an Ease Factor of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, as your next action you must either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending Fatigue and not reserving levels for Penetration. You must roll again to control your addiction, based on the level of the spell you just cast, but you get a +3 bonus to the roll for every spell you cast after the first. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.</p>",

    "description": "<p>There is one born every minute â€” and it is this character! He is an easy victim of ruses, stories and teasing lies. People lying to him get a bonus to their Guile rolls of +1 to +3. </p><p>Depending on how bright or sharp-witted he is, he might not fall for obvious lies, denials of things that are evident or common knowledge. However, he most likely falls for lies that are even remotely plausible, and if he has no idea whether or not something is true, he is almost certain to believe it. This could, for instance, be whether or not there are mischievous faeries under the bridge. If you really want the character to not fall for something, make an Intelligence + Folk Ken Stress roll against an Ease Factor equal to the Communication + Guile roll of the person telling the tall tale. Recommended modifiers to the Ease Factor are +0 for obvious lies (ones that someone without the Flaw would certainly not believe), +6 for outlandish tales and +9 for things which could be true, or lies told by someone in authority, or who has expert knowledge of the subject at hand.</p>",

Attuned to darkness, your eyes are very sensitive, and you suffer from a â€“2 penalty to all rolls involving sight in bright environments such as a cloudless day. Due to your malediction, you lose one Fatigue level per Diameter if outdoors at noon on a hot summer day, and lose levels more slowly in less-intense light and warmth from the sun.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p>The character’s finances rise and fall like the tide, regardless of how successful he is or what preventative measures he takes. He is considered to have the Wealthy Virtue one year, followed by the Poor Flaw the next. Besides monetary concerns, this means that the character will have to only work one season in one year, followed by a year in which he has to work three, all to maintain his livelihood. This cycle of feast and famine continues throughout the character’s life, always in opposition to his financial desires. When he needs money most, he has none, and has an abundance of funds when they are superfluous. </p>",

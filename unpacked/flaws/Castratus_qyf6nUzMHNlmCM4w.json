Social rolls involving characters from Latin culture suffer a –3 penalty. Under Byzantine law you may not marry, although you may adopt children. In Byzantine culture, this may have been an astute career move on your guardians’ part, as eunuchs can attain positions of power. Elsewhere, it was probably the result of an accident or an assault. This Flaw is only available to characters who were born with testicles.</span></p>",

The negative side of its character is brought to the fore, and it acquires one sinful Personality Trait at +6, such as Violent, Gluttonous or Lustful. As part of the corruption, the beast acquires some sort of disgusting or repellent appearance, decreasing its Presence to â€“6. However, should the animal make any attempt to scare or intimidate an opponent, this should be treated as a Presence of +6. Despite this deformity, it is possible (although difficult) to pass the animal off as a natural member of its species. Finally, the creature acquires the Tainted with Evil Flaw which affects the reactions of both humans and other animals towards it. Corrupted Beasts do not react negatively to The Gift.</p></div>",

This does not apply in situations where the answer is evident and any lie would be transparent; he does not claim that the sky is green under normal conditions. However, when he cannot be immediately caught out, he finds it hard to avoid embellishing stories, or simply making them up. Perhaps he wants to make himself look good, perhaps he wants to downplay his own part in a conflict, or perhaps he just loves the power of confusing people.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Flaw is associated with one of six classes of beings: animals, mundane humans, divine beings, faeries, demons, or magical creatures. These last four include characters associated with the Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic realm, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Might.&nbsp;</p><p>Beings of the chosen category react badly to the character, as if he had The Gift, which makes them very uncomfortable around him and gives him a â€“3 to all social interaction rolls with them.&nbsp;</p><p>You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Offensive to more than one kind of being should take Magical Air instead. Characters with The Gift may take this Flaw only if they have the Gentle Gift, which makes this type of being react to them negatively while others are unaffected. Characters with Magical Air may not take it at all.</p><p>If you are offensive to animals, animals with a Might score react in different ways. In general, those that react negatively to The Gift react negatively to you, while those that react positively do not, unless you actually have The Gift.</p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Whether through a flaw in the character’s understanding of doctrine, a moral turmoil, the disheartening absolution of repeated sins, or exposure to conflicting philosophies, he finds it hard to fully express devotion to his faith. Some element of doubt stands between him and the Divine, and all rolls for holy influence, tempering an aura, invoking God’s aid, or invoking a saint or <em>baraka</em> (see <em>Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition,</em> pages 38–41, 87, and 103) suffer a –3 penalty.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character also has an “Uncertain Faith” Personality Trait at +1 that describes this conflict or doubt, which always provides demons with an opportunity to sow further doubt through their Obsession power (<em>Realms of Power: The Infernal</em>, page 31).</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Supernatural Abilities originating from the Divine, including Methods and Powers, are not penalized. This Flaw is not compatible with the True Faith Virtue.</p></div>",

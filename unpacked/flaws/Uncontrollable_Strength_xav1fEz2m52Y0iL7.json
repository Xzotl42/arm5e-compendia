    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This character doesn’t know his own strength, and at times he has trouble controlling it. This Flaw may not be taken if the character’s Strength is below 0. Whenever he handles delicate or fragile objects, whenever care must be taken to knock somebody out gently, and so on, he risks overdoing it, severely. The character must make a stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoid using too much power and causing damage of some kind. In addition to this, any Strength Stress Roll uses one extra botch die.</p></div>",

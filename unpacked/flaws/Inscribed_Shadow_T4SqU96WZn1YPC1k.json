    "description": "<p>The character’s stigmata are reflected by glowing symbols in the character’s shadow. This causes alarm among non-magicians and makes the character’s stigmata extremely easy for other Criamon magi to read (+3 on all rolls). The shadow’s glowing symbols do not vanish when there is insufficient light to form a shadow — they burn brighter. Characters who use magic to hide their stigmata are not acting aptly. Only characters with stigmata may have this Flaw, which normally means that they must be magi of House Criamon.</p>",

As a result, this character can’t apply any experience points earned through an Advancement Total to an Ability or Art that they have already applied experience points to this year. Where they can’t be applied to a different Ability or Art, the experience points are lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Experience points gained through other means, such as Secondary Insight, are unaffected and may be applied normally.</p>",

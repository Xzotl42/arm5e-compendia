You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don’t push your luck — your victim may decide it isn’t worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.</p>",

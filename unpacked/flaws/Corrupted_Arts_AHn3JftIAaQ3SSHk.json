    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character has studied one of the Hermetic Arts from a corrupted source. Use of a corrupted Art for a selfish or sinful action receives a +3 bonus to the character’s Casting Total. Succeeding in a roll because of this bonus (that is, when without it the roll would have failed) means he immediately acquires 5 experience points in that Art. However, uses of the Art that are neutral or selfless receive a –3 penalty, and if you fail the roll because of this penalty, he immediately loses 5 experience points in the Art.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Any use of a corrupted Art taints the character’s magic, causing it to appear unholy. You may only take this Flaw once, though it can affect multiple Arts.</p></div>",

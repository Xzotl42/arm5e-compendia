    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Young merchants often marry for financial reasons. The nobility are often required to marry to form or strengthen alliances. The character has married for money or politics, not love, and seeks solace outside his marital bed. Unhappily married characters must hide their affairs of the heart from their spouses, their spouses’ families, and possibly from their partners’ spouses. In many areas, separation due to infidelity is permitted, although this is not divorce. In many such cases the wife’s dowry must be returned, in part or full. In the case of the nobility, this could even lead to a small, local war, or a Feud.</p></div>",

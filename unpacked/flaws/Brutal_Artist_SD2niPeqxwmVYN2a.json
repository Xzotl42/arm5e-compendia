    "description": "<p>This Flaw is only available to magi of House Jerbiton. The magus creates and enjoys art that is ugly, according to his Housemates. He suffers a â€“3 penalty on social rolls with Jerbiton magi, and cannot develop a positive Reputation in the House, because his mind is so obviously disturbed. This restricts his involvement in the leagues (see <em>Houses of Hermes: Societates,</em> page 53). Over time, the character might convince his sodales that his work is not ugly, but this requires stories, much as removing any other Flaw.</p>",

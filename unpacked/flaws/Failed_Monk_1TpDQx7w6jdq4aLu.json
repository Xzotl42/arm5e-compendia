Because of this, you have a poor Reputation at level 2 in the local area and within the Church. You no longer need to observe your monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, though you may still practice them as they might be ingrained in your nature. You may take Academic Abilities during character creation.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Female characters may take this Flaw as Failed Nun.</p></div>",

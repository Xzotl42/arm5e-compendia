    "description": "<p>The character has two entirely separate lives, in two cities, and moves between the two on some pretext, most likely trade. Bigamists have two spouses, and maintain two households, which they must pay for. If you are using the rules in <em>City and Guild,</em> the merchant’s annual cost of maintaining his business rises by (6 x Wealth Multiplier) Labor Points. Some bigamists mitigate this expense by pretending to be of lower status in their alternate life, which reduces the additional Labor Point cost by half (to 3 x Wealth Multiplier).</p>",

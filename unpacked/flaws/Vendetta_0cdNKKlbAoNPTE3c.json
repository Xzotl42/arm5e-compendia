    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The magus is engaged in one of House Verditius’ vendettas, mostly likely carrying on his parens’s vendetta against another Verditius magus. This vendetta stops just short of physical injury to him or the other. Neither of them will bring this feud to the Quaesitores, wishing to finish it themselves. The magus with whom he is feuding must be an NPC, who regularly takes some sort of action with which the character must contend. This Flaw is generally restricted to magi of House Verditius, as the custom of vendetta is limited to that House. Other characters should take Enemy or Feud to represent a similar situation.</p></div>",

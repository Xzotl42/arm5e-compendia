Wounds magically closed with <em>The Chirurgeon’s Healing Touch</em> (CrCo20), for example, reopen again as soon as he finishes casting the spell, as the magic truly lasts only a moment. He also cannot extract vis from an aura using Creo, since his version of that Art is too unstable for the vis to remain in a lasting physical form.</p></div>",

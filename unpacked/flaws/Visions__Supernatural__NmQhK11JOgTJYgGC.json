A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions usually come to you at quiet times or in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Your visions may warn you of dangers to come, or get you involved in matters you would otherwise have avoided.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The visions come purely at the storyguide's discretion, and reveal only what he wants to reveal.</p></div>",

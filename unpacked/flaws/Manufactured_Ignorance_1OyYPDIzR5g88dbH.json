    "description": "<p>The tainted person has a delusion, but his mistaken belief is sustained by a group of minor demons that provide a stream of supporting evidence. Different groups of demons create varying delusions for tainted people. Many such people believe they have a glorious destiny, and the world smiles at their efforts, because the demons make it appear so. Hermetic demon hunters have found more than one child who believed he was the final scion of a noble house.&nbsp;</p><p>In each story, the character receives one minor, fortunate occurrence that confirms his rosy view of life. Minor fortunate occurrences are situations demons can arrange surreptitiously ahead of time. They may include a character arriving at an inn where the last room is available, finding an important door unlocked, or a coal from the fireplace mysteriously extinguishing itself on the floor rushes.</p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character is bound to a famulus, a familiar demon that possesses an animal and can lend the character its senses, or mask the evil taint of her Powers. This demonic familiar is not loyal to the character or concerned about her well-being, and often has its own goals and needs. The character may occasionally need to bargain with it or even threaten it to receive its aid.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">At the storyguide’s discretion, this Flaw may be taken to represent other sorts of demons with which the character has a close relationship, such as a warder, teacher, or paramour. The more powerful the demon, the more the character will be expected to do to earn its assistance, and the less involved it will be with her on a daily basis.</p></div>",

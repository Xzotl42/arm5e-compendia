Characters making stress rolls in her presence are subject to an additional botch die. Characters may protect themselves through the use of an amulet or a ritual, decided upon by the troupe, which does not need to be magical or supernatural in nature. A Magic Resistance of 0 or more, including the effect of the Aegis of the Hearth, is also sufficient to guard against this effect.</p>",

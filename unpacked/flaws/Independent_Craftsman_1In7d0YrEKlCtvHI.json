    "description": "<p>This character has his own way of working and doesn’t like other people getting in his way. This character always treats his Leadership and Craft or Profession Abilities as three levels lower when working with others on a given task. For Craftsmen, this means that whether he is working as an assistant or working with assistants his Craft Ability has a penalty of –3. This affects the number of assistants he can employ in the workshop and the benefit that he provides when working as an assistant. If you are not using the rules in <em>City and Guild</em> (page 73), treat this is a Personality Flaw.&nbsp;</p>",

The creature has an Infernal Power which it may activate by spending points from its Might Pool. Design the effect as if it were a Hermetic spell, or an Infernal Power, if you have <em>Realms of Power: The Infernal</em>. The level of effect cannot exceed the Corrupted Beast's (Infernal Might + 10). A Greater Power typically costs its magnitude in Might points to activate, and has an Init bonus equal to Qik + magnitude. A power is a Greater Infernal Power if it requires a Penetration total to work. Corrupt Beasts may have this Virtue more than once, each for a different power. Infernal Might increases for each Power acquired.</span></p></div>",

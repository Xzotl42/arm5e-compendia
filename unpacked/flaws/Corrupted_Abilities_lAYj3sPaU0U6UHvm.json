    "description": "<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">One or more of the character’s Abilities was taught to her by a demon, or came through some other corrupted source of study. Use of a corrupted Ability for a selfish or sinful action receives a +3 bonus to the roll. Succeeding in a roll because of this bonus (that is, when without it the roll would have failed) means that the character immediately acquires 5 experience points in that Ability. However, uses of the Ability that are neutral or selfless receive a –3 penalty, and if you fail the roll because of this penalty, the character loses 5 experience points in the Ability.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Any use of a corrupted Ability is an unholy act, which can be sensed by Divine Powers. You may only take this Flaw once, though you can choose to have it affect multiple Abilities if you wish.</p></div>",

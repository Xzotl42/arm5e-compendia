    "description": "<p>The Infernal realm has taken an interest in the character, but he does not know how or why. Perhaps one of his Powers is actually Infernal, or demons are plotting against him, or he is convinced that he is being stalked by something evil. </p><p>He cannot discuss this openly for fear that he will be accused of infernalism, but must be always on his guard against the dark forces that he knows will come for him one day. </p><p>The storyguide will use this Flaw to subtly work the Infernal realm into your character, leaving you unaware of the specifics. You might have other Flaws that relate to the Infernal, but not (yet) know what they are, such as Corrupted Abilities. The character could also simply be Plagued by Demons or Susceptible to the Infernal. Through the course of the story you may eventually discover what his Flaw is, but until then you are only haunted with the knowledge that something about him is not right.</p>",

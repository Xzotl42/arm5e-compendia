Either her parens, or her parensâ€™s parens, is the Primus, and she is one of his descendants. She is at least three places removed from the Primus. She receives undue attention from the House, as they eye her as a prospective Primus. The other magi in the same line may also regard her poorly, hoping to somehow remove her from her heritage. Her ascension to Primus is far from guaranteed, and many events may transpire to prevent her from claiming the title. This should foster very political stories for her. This Flaw can only be taken by magi of House Verditius, as a maga who has left the House is no longer a candidate for Primus. In her case, it would be no more than an interesting feature of her background.</p></div>",

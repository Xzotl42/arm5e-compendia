    "description": "<p>A minor demon poses as a friend of the character. The demon takes a pleasant form but is usually invisible to anyone, other than its charge, who lacks appropriate supernatural abilities. Many of these demons are introduced to the tainted people they will defend and control during infancy. They become childhood playmates.&nbsp;</p><p>The tainted person has not bargained for the services of the demon. Instead, the character receives the services of his friend as part of its master’s plan to guide the character toward a tragic destiny. If the demon feels the character’s life is threatened, it may seek additional assistance from its master. The tainted person believes the demon wishes only the best for him. Many are ignorant of the demon’s true shape.</p>",

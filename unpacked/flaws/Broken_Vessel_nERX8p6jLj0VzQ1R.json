    "description": "<p>The character is constantly aware that her supernatural powers may only be temporary. Failures using those abilities represent the ebbing away of the power that sustains them. When a zero is rolled on any Stress Roll (not Simple Roll) for any of her Supernatural Abilities, Powers, or in casting spells, she loses 5 experience points from that Ability or an Art involved in the Power or Spell. If the roll then botches, the character automatically loses enough experience points to reduce her score in the affected Art or Ability by one full level (or 5 experience points, whichever is greater).Â </p><p>Characters may only take this Flaw if they have at least one Supernatural Ability or Art normally improved through experience points.</p>",

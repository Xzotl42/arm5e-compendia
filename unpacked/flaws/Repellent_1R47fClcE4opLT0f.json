The character makes all rolls requiring trust with a â€“6 penalty. The character also gains a minor advantage from the repellent feature. As examples, a character with horns, claws, or fangs could learn to use them in melee, a scaled character might have a Soak bonus of +3, and a character with demonic eyes might see in the dark.</p></div>",

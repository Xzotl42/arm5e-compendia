Only, his new home does things differently. And theyâ€™re wrong. When making Stress Rolls against his Profession Abilities or any Ability concerning his new covenant, such as Leadership or Folk Ken, this character uses the lower of that Ability score and his current Covenant Lore Ability for his current covenant. Note that bonuses from Puissant or other Virtues still apply to the roll.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This Flaw can also be applied to organizations other than covenants, such as abbeys, universities, guilds, or churches.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p><span style=\"font-family: bookAntiqua\">The creature has a long sinuous body or muscular tail, and can constrict an opponent whose Size is less than its own. Constriction is based on the grappling rules (page @@). The Attack Total is computed using the Brawl skill, and a constriction attack has the following weapon statistics: Init 0, Atk +3, Dfn 0, Dam n/a. As long as the creature maintains the grapple, its opponent is considered deprived of air (see page @@). The victim must make a Stamina check every 30 seconds (that is, every five rounds), or suffer the normal effects of deprivation. Once the creature has successfully grappled an opponent (and begun constricting), on subsequent rounds it can continue constricting and still attack with other weapons. These attacks may be directed at the grappled victim, or at another opponent.</span></p>",

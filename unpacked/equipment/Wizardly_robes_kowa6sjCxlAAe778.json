    "description": "<p><span>A robe made from a durable yet soft fabric. It feels comfortable against the skin, providing warmth without being too heavy.</span></p><p><span><strong>Hood:</strong> A large hood that can easily cover the head, adding to the mystique of the wearer. When not in use, it drapes elegantly over the back.</span></p><p><span><strong>Sleeves:</strong> The sleeves are wide and billowing, perfect for wide gestures and spellcasting.</span></p><p><span><strong>Fastening:</strong> The robe is secured with a simple belt or sash, usually made from the same material.</span></p>",

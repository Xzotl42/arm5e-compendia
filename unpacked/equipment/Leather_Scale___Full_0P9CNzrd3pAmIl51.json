    "description": "<p> Breaking the leather up into a flexible array of scales allows the use of thicker pieces of leather.<span style=\"font-family: 'Weiss'\"> </span></p><p>Full armor adds gauntlets to protect the hands, vambraces for the forearms, chausses for the legs, a closed helm that protects the face, and perhaps additional pieces for the throat, elbows, and knees. Full armor also often includes a gambeson, a heavily padded surcoat worn over the armor. The small auxiliary pieces may be made of a different material than the main cuirass - for instance, a suit of full chain mail might have chain mail to protect the torso and leather scale on the arms and legs (or it might be entirely made of chain mail).</p>",

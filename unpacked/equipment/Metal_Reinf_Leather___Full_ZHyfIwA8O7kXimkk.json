Full armor also often includes a gambeson, a heavily padded surcoat worn over the armor. The small auxiliary pieces may be made of a different material than the main cuirass - for instance, a suit of full chain mail might have chain mail to protect the torso and leather scale on the arms and legs (or it might be entirely made of chain mail). </p></div></div></div></div>",

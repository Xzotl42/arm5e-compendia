    "description": "<p>A minor mystical creature, or group of creatures, resides in the covenant. Their activities are no more harmful than minor vandalism, but cause waste, expense, and arguments. The magi could defeat and destroy these creatures, but it would take time and effort better directed elsewhere. This Hook may be Unknown. </p><p>A Redcap named Marco, who has been unable to locate his trousers on several occasions, reports that in one covenant, the grogs claim that a maiden appears to them in the depth of the night watch, carrying a mug of hot toddy. When they drink it, they fall unconscious, and are usually found naked in a barn. The magi have tried to hunt this faerie, but the grogs have proved almost entirely unhelpful. The ruler of the covenant believes the maiden is actually a prank played by generations of apprentices, abused by slothful grogs.</p>",

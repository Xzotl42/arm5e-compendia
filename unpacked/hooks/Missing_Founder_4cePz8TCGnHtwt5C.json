    "description": "<p>One of the covenant’s founders slipped from Hermetic history indecisively, and this causes the covenant difficulty. For example, rumors emerge that the founder thought gone lives on in Faerie, or someone appears from Arcadia claiming to be his son. Alternately, a will might be found in a book in at Durenmar that gives many of the covenant’s goods to an heir, debtor, or cause. This Hook may be Unknown in the sense that the resumption of the founder’s estate is unexpected.</p>",

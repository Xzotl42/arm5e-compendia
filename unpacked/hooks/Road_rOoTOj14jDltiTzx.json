    "description": "<p>The covenant is on an important mystical trail of some kind, so that mystical creatures, from one or more realms, often turn up at the covenant. </p><p>A most unfortunate covenant lies near the Chapel That Cannot Sleep. The chapel lies on an ancient battlefield, and was raised on the dun that surmounted the fallen. A mythic road, a right of way, sometimes appears when the corpse of a murdered man is carried to a graveyard, and in this case as each body was carried to the site, it created a road. A vast number of roads now leads to the Chapel, stretching out for miles in the direction of the pursuit of the foot soldiers of the losing side. All manner of metaphysical detritus washes up at the Chapel, and disturbs the sleeping dead.</p>",

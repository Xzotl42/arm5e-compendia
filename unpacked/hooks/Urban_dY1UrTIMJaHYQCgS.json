    "description": "<p>The covenant is in a small market town. Many of the inhabitants are not part of the covenant, and the covenant does not rule the town. </p><p>Many Spring covenants in cities lack a Magical aura, and should take the Missing Aura Hook. Older covenants usually have an aura, because they have workspaces out in the countries, have a regio that contains their laboratories, or have created caverns deep below the city where an aura has grown up due to their magical practices.</p>",

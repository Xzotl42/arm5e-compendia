    "description": "<p>An incomplete prophecy is widely known in the area. It causes upheaval whenever someone attempts to complete it. For example, in a castle near a covenant in Wales, there is a horn that can be blown only by the true heir of the ancient kings. Anyone attempting to gain access to the horn is claiming the local nobleman has no right to rule, which leads to trouble, but the horn periodically disappears from the castle, as if seeking an owner. Similar prophecies lead people to disturb resting monsters throughout Mythic Europe.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The covenant was founded through a colonial process when the magi and their primary servants took possession of an area occupied by another people. The covenantâ€™s population is stratified: the new arrivals rule, the indigenous population serve. The covenant would be far more stable, in the long term, if the two groups could reconcile, and perhaps form a hybrid culture, but that is difficult. The indigenous population feels generally angry and vengeful. The incoming population, on the other hand, feels generally superior and is subject to the temptations that the conqueror feels in their treatment of the conquered.</p>",

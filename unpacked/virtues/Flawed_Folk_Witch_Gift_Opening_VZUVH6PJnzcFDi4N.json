    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Opening of the folk witch’s Gift was flawed — she does not treat one of the seven folk witch Supernatural Abilities as favored, and she may not learn the Ability during character generation. This Flaw can be taken  several times, each time for a different Supernatural Ability. She can still learn the Ability at a later date, but she suffers the usual penalties for learning a Supernatural Ability. In addition, even if she does eventually learn the Ability she suffers a –1 penalty on all totals generated with it. This Flaw is Hermetic as it can only be taken by Gifted folk witches; it<br>is normally unavailable to Gifted characters who are not folk witches.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Curses cast by the folk witch are only effective if the curse fetish is within 100 yards of the target. The curse takes effect at the moment that the target moves within range of the completed fetish. Once a disease, aging, or miscarriage curse fetish has thus activated, removing the target from the vicinity of the fetish has no effect on the curse. On the other hand, if a target is removed from the range of an emotion, tongue, paralysis, reduction, or beast curse fetish the effect ceases, but resumes again if the target moves back into range (and the effect manages to Penetrate again) â€” this continues until either the Arcane Connection powering the fetish expires or the fetish is destroyed. This Flaw has no effect on curse potions brewed by the witch. This Flaw is only available if the character is a Gifted Folk Witch or has the Major Supernatural Virtue Cursing. This Flaw is suitable for a Gifted character whose Opening of The Gift was flawed.</span></p>",

You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguideï¿½s discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine). This is not The Gift, and the latent ability is more limited than that.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Virtue is associated with one of five classes of beings: animals, divine beings, faeries, demons, or magical creatures. These last four include characters associated with the Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic realm, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Might. </p><p> The character’s Gift does not bother beings of this sort, although it still has the normal effects on others. For example, Inoffensive to Animals makes it easier for her to get along with mundane beasts. Animals who react positively to The Gift still react positively to her, since she does have The Gift, but those that do not are not disturbed by her presence. </p><p> You may not take this Virtue more than once; characters who are Inoffensive to more than one type of being should take Gentle Gift instead. UnGifted characters may take this Virtue only if they have the Flaw Magical Air.</p><p> Note that Inoffensive to Mundane Humans is not available as a Minor Virtue; take Gentle Gift instead.</p>",

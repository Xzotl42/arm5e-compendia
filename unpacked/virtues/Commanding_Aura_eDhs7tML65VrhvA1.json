Most characters with this Virtue also have the Senior Clergy Social Status Virtue.</p><p> The character has a power equivalent to the Hermetic spell <em>Aura of Rightful Authority </em>(page @@), but with Voice Range; this power has no cost, and no Penetration. The character also has a Magic Resistance and a Soak bonus that depend upon his rank in the Church. If the character carries a relic, this Magic Resistance is <em>added </em>to that of the relic. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Pope:</strong></p><p>Magic Resistance 25, Soak bonus +5.</p><p> <strong>Cardinal, or legatus a latere: </strong>Magic Resistance 20, Soak Bonus +4.</p><p> <strong>Legatus missus: </strong>Magic Resistance 15, Soak Bonus +3.</p><p> <strong>Archbishop: </strong>Magic Resistance 10, Soak Bonus +2. </p><p> </p><p>Papal legates are the representatives of the pope. If the legatus missus — a lower grade with limited powers — delays or deviates from his mission, then his Commanding Aura ceases to work until he completes penance. The Commanding Aura is also lost when a legatus missus completes his mission. </p><p> </p><p>Some lay rulers ordained by the pope (mostly kings and emperors) also have a Commanding Aura. See <em>Realms of Power: The Divine</em>, page 42.</p><p> </p>",

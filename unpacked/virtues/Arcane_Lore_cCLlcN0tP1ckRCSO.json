You get an additional 50 experience points, which must be spent on Arcane Abilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Gifted character who is not a Hermetic magus and knows Parma Magica <em>must</em> take the Major Story Flaw Enemy: Entire Order of Hermes, as magi are bound by their Oath to slay the character on sight, unless he immediately joins the Order. Such a character cannot be played in a normal saga, as the other player characters have to kill him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

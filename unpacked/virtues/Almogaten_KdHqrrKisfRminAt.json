    "description": "<p>The character is the leader of a band of Almogavars, chosen by his fellows for his skill and experience. He commands a dozen men, and he is responsible for their welfare and prosperity. He has Standard Armaments and may take Martial Abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to the Mercenary Captain Virtue, you may choose Wealthy or Poor to represent the fortunes of the almogaten and his soldiers. If he is Poor, he leads only a half-dozen men and he has hit hard times lately. Some of his men only have Inexpensive Armaments, but his main concern is finding the next meal. If he is Wealthy, he leads a company of two dozen men, and can afford to upgrade their armaments. The band might own several horses, and perhaps some herd animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These characters are from the Iberian Peninsula, and if they are particularly far from home the troupe may rule that this is not available as a social status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

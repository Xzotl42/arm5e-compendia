    "description": "<p>The character holds a position within the local hierarchy of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, such as the deputy commander, marshal, or infirmarer. He may give orders to brothers in his region, is accorded the considerable respect due to his position, and has the power to enforce the rule and its various laws, although he answers to the local commander. Because of his high position, he is a well-known figure and has a Reputation of level 2 in his region. You may take this Virtue with any of the Templar Status Virtues, as your character may be a senior brother-sergeant or senior Templar chaplain. This Virtue is compatible with the Temporal Influence Minor Virtue. If you take this virtue with the Templar Commander Major Virtue, then your character holds one of the few exalted ranks within the Templars, such as grand commander or grand marshal, or a rank that has authority over the Eastern or Western region of the order, in which case you likely reside in Acre, Paris, or London.</p><p>Â </p>",

    "description": "<p>Textured vessels are those which have mystical patterns impressed into their surfaces before firing. A </p><p>character with this Virtue has a repertoire of shapes: one shape per level in the Craft: Potter Ability. Each shape corresponds to an Ability, and the character gains additional shapes as the Craft skill increases. The character takes one season to learn each added shape when her Ability increases, and requires the assistance of someone who already knows the new shape desired.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crafting a vessel costs one Long-Term Fatigue level. Each vessel grants a +3 bonus in a single Ability. The materials used while attempting the roll must have been stored inside the vessel. Storing materials for Abilities in pots does not cause Warping. The first time a character uses a pot in this way, it accepts the user as its owner, and provides no bonus for anyone else. A pot is an Arcane Connection to its master. Characters with Magic Resistance cannot be claimed by pots, and gain no benefit from them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A separate version of this Virtue allows the character to make leather vessels, and relies on Craft: Leatherworker. It is otherwise identical. In the African cultures where this Virtue is most common, the pottery version is associated with women, and the leather version with men, but this does not limit which characters can take either Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

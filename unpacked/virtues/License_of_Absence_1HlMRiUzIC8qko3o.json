    "description": "<p>This priest character has a license of absence that relieves him from some duties. The license might be valid for only a few </p><p>years or it could be valid indefinitely. The character has an extra free season each year, but sometimes it is expected that the extra season is used for study. This Virtue is compatible with the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw. A Wealthy priest with a license of absence thus has the whole year free; a character can never have more than four free seasons in a year. A license of absence may only be taken by a character with the Priest Social Status. It may not be taken by Senior Clergy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Summoning is an Elementalist Art that allows the character to use his knowledge of<br>the Elementalist Forms to summon a target associated with that element to him. This target is somehow appropriate to his background â€” a disease, an aspect of nature, or an elemental being, as determined by the type of Summoning he learns (Medicinal, Philosophical, or Theurgical). This is described in more detail under Elementalist Techniques, later in this chapter. Selecting this Virtue gives the character a score of 0 in Summoning.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This Virtue may be taken up to three times, to indicate that the character can summon more than one type of elemental target. The first type chosen requires a Major Virtue, the others are Minor Virtues. Each type of Summoning must be learned separately, but all three types use the same Art score, so that a character that takes this Virtue three times would only have one Summoning Art, not (Medicinal) Summoning, (Philosophical) Summoning, and (Theurgical) Summoning.</span></p>",

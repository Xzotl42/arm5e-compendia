    "description": "<p>The magus uses non-Hermetic methods to cast Hermetic spells. While he still needs to employ obvious ritual actions, these are not the same words and gestures taught as part of Magic Theory within the Order, and other magi who are unfamiliar with the magus’s tradition find it very hard to recognize which spell he is casting. Any attempt to determine the Form of his magical effect (page @@) is made against an Ease Factor of 15, without the magnitude of the effect being subtracted from this Ease Factor as normal. If the character has any Supernatural Abilities, then he uses the same methods to cast his Hermetic magic as he does to use his non-Hermetic magic. The magus cannot choose to use the standard Hermetic methods instead of those of his native tradition, but can choose to reduce or forgo words and gestures in the usual fashion (page @@).</p><p> </p>",

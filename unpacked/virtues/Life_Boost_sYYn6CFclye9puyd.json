    "description": "<p>You may boost your Formulaic or Ritual spell casting totals by expending additional Fatigue levels. Each Fatigue level gives you an additional bonus of +5 on the roll, which can yield very impressive Penetration totals. You may burn more Fatigue levels than you possess. If you do, you must Soak damage, without the help of armor. The Damage total is 5 for every additional Fatigue level spent, plus a stress die. Thus, if you spend three additional levels, you must Soak a damage of 15 + stress die, with your Soak (no armor) + stress die. Fatigue levels spent in this way are spent regardless of the success or failure of the casting roll, and any wounds taken are similarly taken even if you fail to cast the spell. You can kill yourself doing this. The total number of Fatigue levels to be used must be committed before the casting roll is made.</p><p>Â </p>",

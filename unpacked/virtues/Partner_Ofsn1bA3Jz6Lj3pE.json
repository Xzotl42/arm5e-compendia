This provides sufficient income for the character to live as well as a minor member of the nobility, but without military trappings. The company’s capo is answerable to his partners, and they are permitted, when practicable, to take their profits in service from the house’s captains and factors, if they wish. A partner may act in any of the roles of the house without taking the Virtue that corresponds to that role, save the role of capo, with the permission of the troupe. That is, a partner who is also a factor, merchant adventurer, local carrier, or urban merchant need not purchase that Virtue if she has this one.  </p>",

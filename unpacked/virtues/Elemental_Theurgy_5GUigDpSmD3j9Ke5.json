In any season in which the character studies (Realm) Lore appropriate to the realm associated with this Virtue, the player may also assign one free experience point in each of the four Elementalist Forms (Elementalist Air, Elementalist Earth, Elementalist Fire, and Elementalist Water).<br>In addition, when affecting multiple elements with his elemental magic, he may use his highest Form score rather than his lowest. If the highest score exceeds his score in the appropriate (Realm) Lore, use his score in (Realm) Lore instead.</span></p>",

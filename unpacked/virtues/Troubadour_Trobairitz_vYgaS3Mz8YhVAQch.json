    "description": "<p>Troubadours are wandering minstrels and poets (“trobairitz” is the feminine form). The tradition originated in southern France (see <em>Faith and Flame,</em> page 12), but has spread across much of western Europe.</p><p> You are not tied to any community and survive by performing, entertaining, or doing other casual work. You may take Academic skills during character creation and should have a reputation regarding the sort of material you produce and your adherence to the tenets of courtly love. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally, although if you are wealthy, you are supported by someone. Your supporter does not question your activities in any way, however. </p><p> Troubadour characters often possess Virtues such as Famous, Free Expression, Inspirational, Puissant Performance, Social Contacts, True Love, and Well-Traveled.</p><p> </p>",

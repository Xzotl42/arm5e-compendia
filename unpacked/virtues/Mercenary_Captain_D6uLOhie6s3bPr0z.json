During your travels you have gained great wealth — and squandered it — several times over. You may take Martial Abilities during character generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are Poor, you lead only a couple of other mercenaries, but you and they may have armor and weapons available to normal characters. If you are Wealthy you lead about twenty mercenaries, and can delegate some of the work to sergeants. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

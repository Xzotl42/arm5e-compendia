    "description": "<p>Notaries are legal officials employed by lords or towns. </p><p>Your responsibilities include drawing up contracts, witnessing charters, verifying transactions and documents, and affixing a specially designed seal. Notaries generally receive their salary from their employer on Christmas. Notaries only have jurisdiction in specific realms or towns, such as the County of Nimes or the city of Montpellier. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation; however, notaries may not be members of the clergy and are subject to secular law.</p><p>Also available to Eastern Christendom&nbsp;</p>",

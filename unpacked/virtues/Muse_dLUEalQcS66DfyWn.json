A character with this Virtue may grant Free Expression to a single other </p><p>character, or can double the effect of Free Expression that a single character already possesses, while the muse is with him. The artist typically holds the muse in such high regard that he feels the need to continually improve, both in artistic technique and as a person, to be worthy of the museâ€™s attention. Muses may be of either sex, and need not have beautiful bodies.</p>",

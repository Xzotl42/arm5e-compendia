    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The character is a member of the magical tradition of the Mathematici of Bologna. The character may cast charms and perform laboratory activities according to the rules of this chapter. To possess this Social Status, the character must have at least one Hedge Technique and Form from this chapter.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A mathematicus must also possess a Social Status that defines his role in mundane society, suitable examples include: Clerk, Gentleman, Landed Noble, Magister in Artibus, Mendicant Friar, or Priest. The Social Statuses listed in the Universities and Medicine chapters of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Art & Academe </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">are very appropriate, as are those listed in </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Realms of Power: The Divine</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, pages 92-93. These lists are not exhaustive, and the troupe may include additional Social Statuses that are appropriate to the learned magician character. The amount of freedom a mathematicus has to study is based on his other Social Status, or whether he possesses the Wealthy Virtue or Poor Flaw.</span></p>",

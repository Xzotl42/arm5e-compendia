    "description": "<p>The character has inherited or acquired a vast amount of treasure, but it is cursed to cause harm. This treasure might come from an ancestor who made a deal with demons, or tricked them out of money. It might have been stolen from one of the secret caches that demons maintain, so that they have wealth nearby to tempt humans. A tainted person who rebels, and swaps the Tragic Life Flaw for the Plagued by Supernatural Entity Flaw, might be tempted to retain some of the valuable props provided for their role. The treasure is sufficient that the character could transform it into a source of the Wealthy Virtue. As examples, the character could buy a ship and become a trader, or buy land in a city and become a landlord. </p><p> </p><p>The difficulty is that the wealth is cursed, so it lacks the natural increase in bounty that is a gift from God. If traded for other items of value, the curse moves to these items. Any venture into which it is invested will, eventually, fail. Any building it is used to purchase will, eventually, burn down. If it is used for a non-sinful purpose, the treasure destroys itself: gold given to charity turns to sand, ships used to ferry supplies to the starving steer themselves onto rocks. </p><p> </p><p>The wealth may be used to purchase the services of people, who, because they have souls, choose their own fates. The limitation that the wealth only allows itself to be spent sinfully remains, however, so it is likely to be given to amoral, covetous, envious, dangerous people.</p>",

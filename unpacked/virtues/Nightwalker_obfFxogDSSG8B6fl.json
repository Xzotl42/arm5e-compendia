    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A character with this virtue is able to stray; that is, he may send his spirit away from his body, and have it take material form at a distant place. This separated spirit, in  solid or immaterial form, is called a phantasticum</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The ability to generate a phantasticum allows the character to accept responsibilities, and perform acts, that are described in greater detail in the following sections.<br>This Virtue includes all of the following powers:<br>• The character may stray while insensible, and lead others astray.<br>• The character knows a method of forcing insensibility.<br>• The character may use the Second Sight  Ability in phantastic form, and gains a score of 1 in that Ability. He may not use it while in his body, unless he has the Second Sight Virtue. If he does, he has one score in Second Sight that he uses in both situations.<br>• The character involuntarily creates the accouterments usual to his or her tradition while in phantastic form. If these accouterments include traditional weapons, these weapons damage foes despite their apparent fragility.<br>• The character may make his spiritual form tangible or intangible using a Stamina +  Concentration roll.<br>• The character may harm spirits in intangible form, as if both were tangible.<br>• The presence of the character inphantastic form causes drowsiness.<br>• If the character’s tradition uses animal or elemental shapes to travel, for processions, or for fertility battles, the character may do so. While in inhuman form, the character has the combat statistics and senses of a creature of the appropriate species, but retains his Intelligence and identity.<br>• The character may speak to the sleeping, causing them to have dreams, and may converse with people who are awake, although this is arduous.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Virtue also includes the following duties and limitations:<br>• The character’s body appears dead and is  terribly vulnerable while the phantasticum is absent.<br>• The character has the Magical Air Flaw while in phantastic form<br>• The character must muster for every battle or procession, as described below, if these are part of the character’s regionaltradition, and does so involuntarily.<br>• Injuries the character takes in phantastic form are proportionally reflected on the waking form.<br>• The character must not describe the battles or processions, in any detail, to outsiders.<br>• This virtue does not provide Magic Resistance or Might.<br>• Characters in intangible phantastic form may be harmed by spells that affect ghosts or spirits, and may be seen with Second Sight (Ease Factor 9).<br>• Characters in tangible phantastic form may be harmed by anything that would harm mundane versions of their form.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your magic lineage and traditions are from the druids and the vanquished former house of Diedne, making you especially skilled with spontaneous magic. When you cast a spontaneous spell without expending fatigue, you may choose to divide by five or by two. If you choose to divide by five, you need not roll a stress die, and cannot botch, just as normal. If you choose to divide by two, you must roll a stress die, and may botch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you expend fatigue on casting a spontaneous spell, the lowest applicable Art is doubled before the whole total is divided by two. You still roll a stress die, and may botch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You must keep your lineage hidden from the Order, giving you a Major Story Flaw &mdash; Dark Secret is an obvious choice, but you may choose a different one with troupe approval. This is in addition to your normal allowance of Flaws, and does not grant you any points with which to buy Virtues.</p>",

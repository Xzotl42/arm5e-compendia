    "description": "<p>You can vary the effects of Formulaic spells to a slight degree, while still getting the benefits of casting known magic. You may raise or lower the casting level of the spell by one magnitude to raise or lower one (only) of Range, Duration, Target category and Target size by one step, as long as this does not violate any of the normal limits on Formulaic magic. You may instead change one (only) of those parameters to another parameter at the same level, without modifying the casting level, as long as this does not violate any of the normal limits on Formulaic magic. Casting success, Fatigue loss, and Penetration are all calculated based on the final modified level of the spell. You cannot manipulate Ritual magic in this way.</p><p>Â </p>",

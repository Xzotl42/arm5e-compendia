    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The character has been trained as a folk witch. She may perform folk witch laboratory activities such as brewing potions, she uses folk witch casting methods with her Supernatural Virtues and gains the associated magical defenses, and she is a member of a coven who attends sabbat meetings. As she is not supported by a covenant, like a magus is, she must spend two seasons each year supporting herself â€” normally by performing magical services for the local community. This Virtue is compatible with many other Social Status Virtues and Flaws, and with Wealthy and Poor.</span> </p>",

When forced to fight as a group, herd animals temporarily gain the Ferocity Virtue, which they may use to stampede or escape what is threatening them as a group. These animals do not have the Ferocity Virtue when caught on their own, unless taken as a Virtue. For example, a stag might have the Virtue, whereas the deer in his herd have this Quality.</p>",

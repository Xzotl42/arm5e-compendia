This works exactly the same as the Healing Ability except that it works on animals instead of people (expending Animal vis instead of Corpus). A folk witch character can also make potions using this Ability. This is not normally a Favored Ability of folk witches, although it is for some variant covens. The character may also have the Healing Ability</span> </p>",

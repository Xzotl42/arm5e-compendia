    "description": "<p>The character is a member of a band of mercenaries and raiders, living a life of adventure according to a code of honor and discipline. He shares a bond of solidarity with his fellows, and they can depend on each other’s loyalty. He has Standard Armaments, and may take Martial Abilities. He may choose to be the Adalil, the second-in-command, at no additional cost, getting an increase in both authority and responsibility. He is supported by his unit, and may not take the Poor Flaw or Wealthy Virtue.</p><p> </p><p>These characters are from the Iberian Peninsula, and if they are particularly far from home the troupe may rule that this is not available as a social status.</p><p> </p>",

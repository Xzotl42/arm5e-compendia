    "description": "<p>This Virtue is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane animals, faeries, or magical beings. These last two include characters associated with Faerie or the Magic realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Faerie or Magic Might.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These beings are strangely drawn to the character, and generally trust or obey her without thinking. She gets +3 on Communication and Presence rolls to affect them. Characters who are Offensive to beings of this sort cannot take this Virtue, including those who have The Gift or Magical Air, though characters who are Inoffensive to them or have the Gentle Gift may.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that while Alluring to Magical Beings can affect Hermetic magi, the Parma Magica protects against this effect as part of resisting the social penalties of The Gift. Might and other forms of general Magic Resistance do not hinder this effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This means that the character may carry out the various rituals and ceremonies, such as the Yasna, Vivevdat, Navjote, marriage, burial, official prayers, purification rituals, lighting of sacred fires, and initiation of new priests. In Mazdean communities, your character is held in high regard and treated with great respect. The character wears pure white clothes and, when performing ceremonies, covers his face with a white veil to protect the sacred flame from his breath and saliva. See <em>The Cradle and the Crescent,</em> Chapter 5 for more details on Mythic Zoroastrianism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a mobed, your character resides in a community that likely has a fire temple. This means that your character has arduous and time-consuming religious and ceremonial duties. Most of your time is spent praying, performing ritual purification rites and tending to the sacred fire. If you are Wealthy, you have several ervads (junior priests) who perform many of the more arduous tasks. If you are Poor, it likely reflects the poor station of Mazdeans in the community in general, and you may also possess the Outsider Flaw.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your character may take Academic Abilities at character generation. Most such characters take the Minor Personality Flaw Vow to reflect your constant state of ritual purity, and dedication to your community. This can only be your characterâ€™s social status if he lives in a Mazdean community, all of which are to the east of Mythic Europe, and most of which are in Persia. A </p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">Mazdean priest</span></p><p> in exile in Europe should take a different Social Status Virtue or Flaw, as discussed earlier.

This includes fast-casting a spell that is the same as or very similar to one of his Formulaic spells, though he does not get this bonus if he has the Fast Cast Ability for a mastered spell, since in that case you add his Mastery Ability instead. This bonus does not stack with other bonuses to his Casting Total, nor does it stack with itself if the magus happens to know several similar spells.</p><p>Â </p>",

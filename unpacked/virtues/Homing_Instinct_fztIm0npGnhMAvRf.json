To add a location to the character’s repertoire she must be at that location, the location must be open to the air (so it cannot be inside, for example), and the player must make an Intelligence + Concentration Roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If this would increase the number of known locations beyond the character’s limit, then another location must be “forgotten.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the character has a fixed Arcane Connection to locations that she knows, which may be exploited in the usual ways (page @@). This Arcane Connection is an artifact of the mind, and so may not be given to another character.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

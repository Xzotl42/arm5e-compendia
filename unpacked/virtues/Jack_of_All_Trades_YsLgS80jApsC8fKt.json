    "description": "<p>The character is capable of turning his hand to almost anything. He suffers no additional botch dice for attempting an Ability roll for an Ability that he has no score in (see page @@). If it is an asterisked Ability, then he can attempt a roll as if he had a score of zero with three extra botch dice, <em>if and only if </em>he is normally able to take Abilities of that type. Characters without this Virtue cannot even attempt rolls on an asterisked Ability without at least one experience point in it. For example, he must have a Virtue permitting him to take Arcane Abilities to attempt an unskilled Magic Lore roll. Some Abilities are excepted from this Virtue, including those that are not rolled (such as Parma Magica or Penetration), and all Supernatural Abilities (which require a specific Virtue for each Ability, rather than the type). The troupe may make other exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but this Virtue is supposed to allow the character to attempt things that would normally require training.</p><p> </p>",

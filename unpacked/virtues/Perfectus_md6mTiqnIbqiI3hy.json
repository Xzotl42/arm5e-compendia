    "description": "<p>You are one of the leaders of the Cathar heretics, found mainly in southern France. </p><p>Your responsibilities include preaching the Gospel, abstaining from eating meat and dairy produce, from sex and romance, and from other acts that ensnare you in the sinful world. You should normally take the Flaw: Vow to represent your solemn religious obligations. You may not take the Wealthy Virtue, as you are supported by the tithes and contributions of your congregations. As a heretic you are at great risk from the Church, which will execute you if you are caught and refuse to recant your beliefs. Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation. You may take the Purity and Transcendence Supernatural Abilities from <em>Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition</em> (page 53)<em> </em>if your character has the True Faith Virtue, but these are not free Virtues. You may, however, take them as Virtues, as normal. More details on the Cathars can be found in <em>Faith and Flame</em>, from page 13.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

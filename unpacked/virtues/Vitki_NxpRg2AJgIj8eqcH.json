    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The character is a Norse rune wizard, believed by magi to belong to a group called the Order of Odin. At one time he was respected and feared by other men living in the north, but now very few of his people even know his kind exists. He is still considered by many magi to be an enemy of the Order of Hermes, and those who discover what he is may try to hunt him down and kill him, or else attempt to force him to teach them his magical secrets.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Vitkir may take Arcane Abilities, Martial Abilities, or Academic Abilities during or after their apprenticeship, just like Hermetic magi, as long as these Abilities are appropriate to their mastersâ€™ backgrounds (for example, an academic vitki is unlikely to teach his apprentice Great Weapon, and a warrior vitki probably does not ensure his followers are well versed in Philosophiae).</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">All vitkir must take this as their Social Status Virtue, and it is only available to them.</span> </p>",

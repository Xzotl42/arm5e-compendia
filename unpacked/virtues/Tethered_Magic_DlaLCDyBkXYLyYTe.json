    "description": "<p>You can pass control of your non-Ritual spells to others, just as if they were the caster, “tethering” the magic to them for the spell’s duration. You may also tether a spell to an object, which can then transfer the spell to an appropriate target when it comes into range. This can even be done whenever you activate an effect in a magic item. However, a side effect of this sort of magic is that all of your spells and the effects of any magic items you activate are Arcane Connections to you.</p><p> </p>",

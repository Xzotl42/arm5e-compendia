The character has the use of the item, without having to deal with the demon that created it. The item is extremely useful in some way, but each use draws its owner closer to the character, as the demon attempts to reclaim its treasure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most Infernal heirlooms have only a single effect, and they are usually triggered by a minor act of, or intention to, sin. As a guideline, each heirloom may create an effect once per day that is equivalent to a Hermetic spell of level 25. Items that produce less powerful effects may be used more frequently at the troupeâ€™s discretion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

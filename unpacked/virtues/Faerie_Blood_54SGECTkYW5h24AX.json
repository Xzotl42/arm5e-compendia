    "description": "<p>Somewhere in your ancestry there is a faerie, and this relation gives you an intuitive grasp of the motivations and personalities of those supernatural folk. Faeries are more comfortable around you than around other humans, and given time, may even forget the mortal blood in your veins.</p><p> You are resistant to aging, and get –1 to all aging rolls.</p><p> Type of Faerie Blood (pick one, or create a similar one):</p><p> <strong>Blood of the Bee King</strong>: The descendants of Bee Kings may give simple instructions to bees they touch, and may understand the thoughts dominating hives of bees. They are unable to give bees instructions that will kill them, except to command warrior bees to attack, since warrior bees are so willing to die. (Penetration 25)</p><p> <strong>Dwarf Blood</strong>: You are descended from the master craftsmen of the fay, and get a +1 bonus to any total including a Craft Ability.</p><p> <strong>Goblin Blood</strong>: Your ancestors were the sneaky inhabitants of the shadows underground, and you get a +1 bonus on all totals involving stealth.</p><p> <strong>Satyr Blood:</strong> The satyrs are notoriously lecherous. You get a +1 bonus to Communication and Presence totals when dealing with sexually compatible characters.</p><p> <strong>Sidhe Blood:</strong> You are descended from one of the noble fay who rule the lands of Summer and sunlight. Because of the striking and unusual qualities of your nature add +1 to your Presence, but not to more than +3. Many mortals may consider you fascinating or alluring.</p><p> <strong>Spinnen Blood</strong>: A character who has Spinnen Blood can convert his or her own body weight of fiber into cloth per day, simply by touching it. Old cloth, or products made of cloth fibers, can be unwoven using the same ability, but this counts toward the maximum weight of cloth a character can alter per day. Some Spinnen, particularly those who have served as companions to magi, create other useful objects, like tents, ropes, or sails in lieu of the same weight of cloth. These characters are from a single family line that originated near Ghent; see <em>The Lion and the Lily,</em> page 97, for details of how most of the family live.</p><p> <strong>Undine Blood</strong>: The undines are the faeries of the water, and you get a +2 bonus to any action taken underwater, which will partially offset any penalty applied.</p><p> Characters with Faerie Blood can learn Faerie Lore at character generation.</p>",

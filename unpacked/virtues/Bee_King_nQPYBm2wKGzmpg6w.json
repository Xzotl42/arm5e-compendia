    "description": "<p>Bee Kingship is the result of descent from particular faeries, and thus a form of faerie blood. It grants the following advantages: </p><p> Bee Kings do not appear to age after reaching maturity, but every Bee King not killed by circumstances dies of a rapid illness precisely a century after birth. </p><p> Any Bee King may command any group of bees to perform any action of which they are physically capable, even if it will lead to their deaths. Usual instructions like attacking people, increasing the population of the hive, or constructing objects from wax continue to be performed until the instruction is countermanded (Penetration 50). Simple commands of a sentence or less long can be given orally. </p><p> Bee Kings may communicate complex messages to bees by having a single bee land on the Bee King’s tongue. This bee then acts as the king’s representative to the hive. Bee Kings can understand the speech of hives, and can read the minds of bees that they are touching. </p><p> Bee Kings are never stung by any variety of biting insect. An attacking bee swarm is treated as an environmental effect, rather than an opposing mêlée group. The swarm does +10 damage automatically each round. This damage may be Soaked normally.</p><p> </p><p>Note that, in Mythic Europe, bees have kings, not queens, but a female character with this Virtue may choose to call herself a Bee Queen.</p><p> This is a Supernatural Virtue, and you cannot lose it when being trained as a magus (see page @@). If your master cannot preserve the ability, you cannot be trained.</p><p> </p>",

This masterpiece must be a lesser enchanted item. You should design a lesser enchanted item that your character could make based on his Lab Totals at character generation, following the regular rules for construction of such a device. You ignore vis costs, as the magus’s parens provided those from her laboratory stores. This Gauntlet test is standard for House Verditius, but a maga from another House may have chosen to impose it.</p>",

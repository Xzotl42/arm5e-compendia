    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The character is the leader of a gruagach collective. The character has unGifted students who provide him with many of the necessities of life. In exchange for these necessities, the character must spend one season per year training those students. If the character is Poor, he only has a few followers with relatively few resources, so he must spend a normal amount of time every year on supporting himself, in addition to the time spent teaching. If the character is Wealthy, he has many apprentices or a few of means. The troupe should determine the level of experience of the students and their identities.</span></p>",

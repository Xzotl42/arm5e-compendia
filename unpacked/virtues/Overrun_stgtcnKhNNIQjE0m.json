    "description": "<p>This effect only applies if the creature has charged into combat, exerting itself for this attack. If the attack is successful, the opponent must make a Dexterity + Athletics stress roll against an Ease Factor equal to (Damage Total (before soak) + creature’s Size – opponent’s Size). If the roll fails, the opponent lands on the ground a number of feet away equal to the creature’s Size, taking falling damage in the process. He must spend his next action regaining his feet, although the creature normally follows up with a trample. Prone characters cannot parry, but must use Brawl to defend themselves.</p>",

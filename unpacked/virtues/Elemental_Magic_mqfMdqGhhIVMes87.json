    "description": "<p>You have been trained in the ability to manipulate raw elemental Forms (Aquam, Auram, Ignem, and Terram), and view them as a connected whole rather than four separate Arts. Whenever you gain experience from a source dedicated to one of these Arts, you gain half the Source Quality (rounded up) in experience points in each of the other three Arts. For example, if you studied Ignem from a book with a Source Quality of 13, you would gain 7 experience points in each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram.</p><p> </p><p>During character creation, assign all your experience points in Arts. Then assign half the experience points assigned to each of the elemental Forms to each of the other elemental Forms. Do not actually add these experience points to the Form in question until you have finished calculating all the bonus experience points. For example, if you assign 10 experience points to each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram, and 21 experience points to Ignem, then you should assign 15 bonus experience points to Ignem (5 from each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram), and 21 bonus experience points to each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram (11 from Ignem, and 5 each from the other two Forms).</p><p> </p><p>In addition, if a spell with one of these Forms as its primary Form has another element as a requisite, you use the primary Form to calculate totals, even if the requisite is lower.</p><p> </p>",

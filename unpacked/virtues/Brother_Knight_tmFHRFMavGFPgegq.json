You have sworn a lifelong vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, and are answerable only to your superiors and the pope. Unless you are Poor, you may have high-quality weapons and armor, and two horses. You may take Academic and Martial Abilities during character generation. You wear the symbol of your order on your distinctive surcoat, which is usually pure white (Templars, Hospitallers) or golden (Teutonic knights).</p><p> This Virtue is only available to male characters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Controlling is an Elementalist Art that can be combined with mastery of the four elements to control the behavior of different types of beings, as described under Elementalist Techniques, later in this chapter. Taking this Virtue gives the character a score of 0 in Controlling.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This Virtue may be taken up to three times, to indicate that the character can control multiple types of elemental targets (Medicinal, Philosophical, or Theurgical). The first type chosen requires a Major Virtue, the others are Minor. Each type of Controlling must be learned separately, but all three use the same Art score, so that a character who takes this Virtue three times would have only one Controlling Art, not (Medicinal) Controlling, (Philosophical) Controlling, and (Theurgical) Controlling.</span></p>",

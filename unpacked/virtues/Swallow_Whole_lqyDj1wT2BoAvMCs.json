    "description": "<p>The creature can swallow whole any creature of Size 4 or more smaller than the creature itself. The victim can struggle to escape, but the confining nature of the gullet permits only Brawl attacks. It is impossible to breathe inside the creature, requiring deprivation rolls (page @@) even if the victim escapes the grapple. Three rounds after being swallowed, the victim reaches the stomach. The powerful acids inflict +9 damage every round, complete immersion quadruples this to +36 (page @@). A character may be able to brace himself and avoid complete immersion: make a Strength + Athletics roll each round: Ease Factor 6 results in only half immersion (triple damage), Ease Factor 9 results in immersion of a limb (double damage), and Ease Factor 12 means just a splash (normal damage). The creature cannot swallow a second creature until the previous one has reached the stomach.</p>",

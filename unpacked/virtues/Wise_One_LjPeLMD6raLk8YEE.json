You are probablymagical, and will probably want to purchase a Virtue that gives you some sort of supernatural ability. You are well regarded in the community, although your presence may cause fear as well as awe or respect. If you lack such good standing, though, you are most likely a wanderer or an outcast.</p><p>You may take either Arcane or Academic Abilities, but not both, at character creation.</p><p>The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>A character who drinks from a magical water vessel made by a character with this Virtue may swap one Ability score for the Craft: Potter score of the crafter at the time the vessel was made. This effect lasts for one scene or three minutes, whichever is longer. Each vessel is tied, at its cre- ation, to a particular Ability, by its shape. </p><p>Each character knows a variety of vessel shapes, each shape corresponding to a single Ability. A starting character knows a number of shapes equal to her Craft: Potter score. The character takes one season to learn a new shape when her Ability increases, and requires the assistance of someone who already knows the new shape desired. Making a vessel costs a Long-Term Fatigue level.</p><p>After a vessel is drunk from the first time, it takes the drinker as its owner. Other drinkers gain no benefit from the vessel, and it becomes an Arcane Connection to its owner. Characters with Magic Resistance cannot be claimed by vessels. The first drink from an unowned vessel, which establishes ownership, causes Warping, unless the drinker has Supernatural Virtues. Similarly, drinking from a vessel one does not own causes Warping, unless the drinker has Supernatural Virtues.</p><p>A separate version of this Virtue allows the character to make leather vessels, and relies on Craft: Leatherworker. It is otherwise identical. In the African cultures where this Virtue is most common, the pottery version is associated with women, and the leather version with men, but this does not limit which characters can take either Virtue.</p><p> </p>",

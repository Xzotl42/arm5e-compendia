    "description": "<p>You have been blessed by some supernatural power. The effects of the benediction should be comparable to other Major Virtues. (See insert page @@ for examples.)</p><p> </p><p>The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will.</p><p>If you take the Virtue once, this is a single power, equivalent to a Formulaic Hermetic spell with a level of 50 or lower. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero.</p><p> </p><p>This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers. For example, a character who took the Virtue twice could have a power with a level of 60 and a Penetration of 0, and a second power with a level and Penetration of 20 each. By default, there should be one power per Virtue, as this Virtue is intended for powers that are individually significant. See Lesser Power if you want your character to have multiple minor powers. However, the troupe may allow the character to take more powers if they have a strong thematic link.</p><p> </p><p>The power has an Initiative equal to the character’s Quickness – (power magnitude/2) (rounded down). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 50, or two Fatigue levels if its level is 51 to 100. Higher level effects are unlikely to make sense.</p><p> </p><p>This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as <em>Realms of Power: The Divine, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, </em>or <em>Hedge Magic Revised Edition</em>, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)</p><p> </p>",

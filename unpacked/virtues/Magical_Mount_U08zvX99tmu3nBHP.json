    "description": "<p>The character has a mount, beast-of-burden, or “guard dog,” a creature that has Cunning instead of Intelligence and a Magic Might Score of up to 25. It has an extra Personality Trait (Loyal 0) and will obey simple verbal commands. If it has a positive Cunning score, the creature is also able to perform limited acts on its own initiative. If the character is incapable of training the creature himself, it must have been a gift from another character (probably a powerful magus) and the character must take a Major Story Flaw to represent the consequences: Favors, to represent his debt to his patron, is the simplest, but Enemies, if the </p><p>mount was lured away, is also a possibility. In this case, only a companion or magus-level character can take this Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

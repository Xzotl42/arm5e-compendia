He has access to the resources of the Church and may have additional duties and powers according to his office. </p><p> </p><p>You may make take either the Wealthy or Poor Virtue/Flaw for the character. This does <em>not </em>necessarily represent the status of the character’s diocese — instead it represents the personal wealth of the character. <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">Senior clergy </span>can amass wealth by receiving the benefice of several offices. Indeed, it is not unusual for a character to receive the benefice from various parishes scattered throughout Mythic Europe. He may never even visit some of the dioceses in which his parishes are located, although obviously the character needs to employ a curate to discharge the actual priestly duties in these remote parishes. </p><p> </p><p>The character has a Reputation of level 4, either good or bad, in both the local community and the Church. </p><p> </p><p>You may purchase Academic Abilities for the character during character generation. </p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">Senior clergy </span>are subject to canon law, and must be celibate and tonsured (if male). Note whether the character has been ordained as a deacon, priest, bishop, etc. Abbess is the only common position available to women with this Virtue, and even such women are not ordained. The Paid Rights Virtue does not enable women to take any of the other positions.</p><p>Also available for Eastern Christendom </p>",

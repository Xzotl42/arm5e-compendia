    "description": "<p>The character has concentrated in one of the seven subjects of Artes Liberales, in preference to the other six. He may add +3 to his Artes Liberales score for that subject. However, he must subtract 1 from Artes Liberales rolls and totals for the subjects he did not concentrate in. Include the bonus and penalty modifier in every total that Artes Liberales is used for, including writing books. This Virtue is incompatible with the Virtue Puissant Artes Liberales. Puissant Artes Liberales means a character is particularly adept with all seven liberal arts, while Academic Concentration means the character focused on one liberal art in preference to the others. </p><p> </p><p>With troupe approval, this Virtue could be extended to Philosophiae. It is not allowed for any other Ability besides Artes Liberales and Philosophiae.</p><p> </p>",

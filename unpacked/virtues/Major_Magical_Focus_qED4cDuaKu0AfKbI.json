    "description": "<p>Your magic is much more potent in a fairly limited area, such as weather, necromancy, birds, or emotions. This area should be smaller than a single Art, but may be spread over several Arts – necromancy, for example, covers both Corpus and Mentem effects. You cannot be focused on laboratory activities, although a focus does apply to laboratory activities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sample Major Magical Foci</strong> :</p><p>This list is merely exemplary. Other foci are possible.</p><p> <strong>Animal</strong>: Birds, or mammals, or domesticated animals.</p><p> <strong>Aquam</strong>: Salt water or fresh water.</p><p> <strong>Auram</strong>: Weather.</p><p> <strong>Corpus</strong>: Men or women.</p><p> <strong>Herbam</strong>: Trees or food plants.</p><p> <strong>Imaginem</strong>: Visual images, auditory images, tactile images, or taste and smell together.</p><p> <strong>Mentem</strong>: Emotions or memories.</p><p> <strong>Terram</strong>: Metals or stone.</p><p> <strong>Necromancy</strong>: Corpus and Mentem as applied to the bodies and spirits of dead people.</p><p> <strong>Damage</strong>: Any Art, as long as the effect does damage directly, either by inflicting a wound or doing a certain amount of damage which can be soaked.</p><p> <strong>Disguise</strong>: Changing the appearance of something, by any means.</p><p> When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice. If a spell has requisites, the lowest applicable score may be one of the requisites, rather than one of the primary Arts. Thus, if a magus with a focus on birds was casting a spell to turn a bird into pure flame, MuAn (Ig), with Muto 14, An 18, and Ig 10, his final total would be 34 + other modifiers: 14 from Muto, and 20 from adding Ignem twice. If he was casting a spell to turn a bird into another sort of bird, MuAn with no requisites, his total would be 46 + other modifiers, 18 from Animal and 28 from adding Muto twice.</p><p> A character can have only one Magical Focus, either major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.</p><p> </p>",

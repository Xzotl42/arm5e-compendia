    "description": "<p>The character is technically a brother-knight or brother-sergeant for the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, but is really an administrator for the order’s many holdings and activities. While he has sworn the Templar oath and vows, and lives a monastic life, his many duties mean he is likely to never see active combat. He is answerable only to his superiors in the order and to the pope. He may have considerable influence and access to enormous resources, but no additional time. You may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This Virtue can replace the Brother-Knight, Brother-Sergeant, and Brother-Priest Status Virtues. This Virtue is only available to male characters.</p><p> </p>",

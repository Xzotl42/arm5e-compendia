The character may work at her trade, following the same procedures as the regular male workers. Every guild allows such members, so she may practice any craft she desires. The character must select a separate guild Social Status Virtue as well as this free Virtue to represent her status in the guild system. This Virtue is only available to female characters, and is compatible with all Social Status Virtues reflecting status in a guild.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The character has a supernatural affinity with the four elements, specifically how they interact with each other. If the character studies one of the four Elementalist Forms (Elementalist Air, Elementalist Earth, Elementalist Fire, or Elementalist Water) during a season, he may assign one additional experience point to each of the other three. If he gains experience in more than one Form in a single season (perhaps from Adventure experience), he cannot assign more than one<br>free experience point to each Ability.<br>In addition, when affecting multiple elements with his elemental magic, he may use the highest Form score among them rather than the lowest.<br>A Hermetic version of this Virtue is relatively common among magi of the Order of Hermes (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">ArM5</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, page 41), and affects the Forms of Aquam, Auram, Ignem, and Terram instead of the elemental powers.</span> </p>",

Maybe he is currently employed by a covenant, once served in the retinue of a magus, or has had other dealings or disputes with them. In any case, you have an additional 50 experience points to spend on Order of Hermes Lore, Magic Lore, or Latin. You cannot spend other experience points on Magic Lore or Latin unless the character has another Virtue or Flaw permitting this. This Virtue may be taken by any grog or </p><p>covenfolk, or those who have had an exceptionally close relationship with the Order of Hermes. It <em>may</em> be taken by a magus, but there is usually no point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

You may not take immunity to aging — see the Unaging Minor Virtue (page @@) instead. This immunity applies to mundane and magical versions of the thing. If you are immune to fire, you are also immune to magically created fire.</p><p>One important possibility is immunity to deprivation, which means that you suffer no loss of Fatigue or wounds from going without air, food or drink. However, you cannot regain long-term Fatigue without rest and sustenance, and if you are injured deprivation could cause your wounds to worsen.</p><p>You may take this Virtue more than once, with a different immunity each time.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>You are a rich member of your class. You may spend three seasons per year on study or ad</p><p>venturing, as you can pay people to look after your interests, and these seasons are genuinely free. Exactly how wealthy you are depends on your social class; a noble would have at least a dozen servants, including some bodyguards, while a wealthy townsman would have a good house and maybe three servants. Whatever your class, you are wealthy enough to afford goods generally associated with a higher class, and thus risk being labeled a vulgar social climber. Wealthy characters may live at a covenant, but they are not supported by the covenant. As all Hermetic magi are supported by their covenant, no magi may take this Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

You have sworn a lifelong vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, but this may not be enforced as strictly for you as it would be for a <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">brother knight</span>. You are answerable only to your superiors in the order and the pope. Unless you are Poor, you may have high-quality weapons and armor, and two horses. You may also take Martial Abilities during character generation. You wear the distinctive symbol of your order on your surcoat, which is usually colored black or gray. This Virtue is only available to male characters.</p><p>Â </p>",

    "description": "<p>Your magical lineage and traditions are from the Roman priests of Mercury, which predate the Order of Hermes, making you especially skilled with Ritual Magic and magic used in conjunction with others. In addition to your standard spell allocation, you also know Wizard’s Vigil (page @@) at a level equal to the highest level of Ritual spell that you know, and should you invent or learn a Ritual spell of higher level, you automatically invent a Wizard’s Vigil spell of the same level, without needing to spend extra time.</p><p> When casting a spell using Wizard’s Vigil (page @@) or other spells, such as Wizard’s Communion (page @@), with the same function, you may add your Mastery score (page @@) in the spell being cast and your Mastery score in Wizard’s Vigil to the effective level of the Wizard’s Vigil.</p><p> Finally, any Ritual spells which you cast have only half the usual vis requirement. If cast as part of a Wizard’s Vigil, all the participants need to have this Virtue to gain this benefit.</p><p> All known members of the Mercurian lineage also have the Minor Flaw Ceremonial Spontaneous Magic.</p>",

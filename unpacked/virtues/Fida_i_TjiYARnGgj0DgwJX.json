A <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">fida’i </span>is a devout member of the sect who is prepared to die on its orders, and as such he should consider taking either the Oath of Fealty or Dutybound Flaw. When not on a mission, a <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">fida’i </span>wears white, with a red girdle, cap, or boots. He has been trained in precise placement of daggers and blades, as well as disguise. <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">Fida’i </span>may take Martial Abilities at character creation. He can expect to become a lasiq if he proves his loyalty to the sect. </p><p>This Social Status Virtue may be taken by a character who is living far from the home of the Nizaris, as the assassins are sent on missions, and may be sent far away. Such a character should have a Story Flaw representing his mission, and choose the Social Status he is pretending to have. See <em>The Cradle and the Crescent,</em> from page 162, for more detail on the Nizaris.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The character </p><p>is able to take on any human form, so long as it does not identifiably belong to a particular human being. The character develops this ability because his body has adopted the almost-gaseous property of demonic flesh, so any apparent changes in size or fitness are cosmetic, and do not affect the characterâ€™s statistics. Some amorphous people can select a single shape at midnight, which is the Major form of the Virtue. Its Minor form allows the character to change shape only after having performed a significant act linked to the Obsession of the sponsoring demon. The character may only change to his birth form by selecting it once the conditions of transformation have been met, or involuntarily changing shape when dying or entering holy ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Tainted</p>",

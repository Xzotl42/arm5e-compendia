    "description": "<p>The character is an associate member of the Poor </p><p>Knights of the Temple of Solomon, and has taken one or two of the Templar vows. His membership is generally temporary (although it need not be), and he may possess other Social Status Virtues or Flaws to reflect his true station, such as Clerk, Knight, Landed Noble, Peasant, or even Hermetic Magus. His former outside status affects his treatment in the order â€” knights and nobles receive more respect than commoners. Women may also become associate members (consoeurs), although they are housed separately from the men. Associates are governed by the same rule as full members, although they have fewer rights. Some associates may hold important positions within a particular Templar commandery, especially if they possess a valuable skill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

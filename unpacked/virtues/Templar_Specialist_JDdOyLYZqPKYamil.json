    "description": "<p>The character works as a skilled employee of the Poor </p><p>Knights of the Temple of Solomon, filling a crucial role for which the Templars have no full or associate member, such as craftsmen, blacksmiths, artisans, notaries, squires, soldiers, scribes, or translators. You may take one restricted group of Abilities during character creation, such as Academic or Martial Abilities. As a servant of the Templars, the character is covered by the papal bull exempting him from secular and lay authority, and is generally accorded some respect. This Virtue may be taken by Muslim characters, who will typically act as translators (and who should also take the Outsider Flaw or similar).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

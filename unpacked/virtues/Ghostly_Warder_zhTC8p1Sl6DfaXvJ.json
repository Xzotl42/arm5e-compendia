    "description": "<p>A ghost watches over you. It might be a grandparent, a childhood friend, or anyone else who cares for you enough to stay around after death. The ghost is invisible and silent to all but you and those with Second Sight (see page 67). It can see and hear what is going on around you and makes an excellent spy, since it can leave your presence once per day for up to half an hour. However, death does not leave people in their normal state of mind, so the ghost probably has some quirks that make it less than dependable ï¿½ it might even encourage you to join it on the other side. The ghost has 300 experience points in various Abilities that it can use to advise you, and ghosts may take any Abilities. See page 194 for an example of a  ghostly warder.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The character is a member of Clan Ilfetu within </p><p>House Bjornaer, and has received extra training in the rituals of the House. You receive 50 extra experience points that may be spent on House Bjornaer Lore, Magic Lore (with a specialty in the Great Beasts), and Gothic, the dead language that the House uses for all of its rituals. It is possible that the magus has also been Initiated into the Esoteric Mystery of Divination and Augury (see <em>The Mysteries Revised Edition,</em> page 58); if so, that Virtue must be purchased with the normal allowance of ten points of Virtues and Flaws. Clan Ilfetu teaches the Divination method of haemagmomancy, which is divination by observing the blood splatters of wounded animals; this gives the following bonuses to Divination: +5 family, +3 Corpus. See <em>Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults,</em> page 12, for more details on House Bjornaer and the role of Clan Ilfetu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

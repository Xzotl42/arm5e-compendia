    "description": "<p>The character is a judge, advocate, or procurator — essentially a medieval lawyer in some capacity. At character generation he may purchase the Abilities Latin, Artes Liberales, and Civil and Canon Law. He is not necessarily university trained, as he may have obtained his education through private schools, tutors, or a cathedral school, and need not have a degree. If he is a cleric, he works in an ecclesiastical setting: the papal curia, the College of Cardinals, or a bishop’s or archbishop’s office. If he is a layman, he works for a secular prince or town municipality. </p><p> This Virtue is compatible with the Baccalaureus, Magister in Artibus, and Doctor in (Faculty) Virtues, as a <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, 'Times New Roman_EmbeddedFont', 'Times New Roman_MSFontService', serif\">jurist </span><em>may </em>have a university education. It is also compatible with the Priest and Mendicant Friar Virtues. It is only available to male characters.</p><p> Also available in Eastern Christendom</p>",

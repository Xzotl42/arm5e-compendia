The character may perform gruagach laboratory activities and is a member of a gruagach collective. This Virtue is compatible  with many other Social Virtues and Flaws, and with Wealthy and Poor. A normal gruagach must spend time supporting himself. UnGifted gruagachan usually do this by performing their normal vocations, but more-powerful Gifted gruagachan may perform services for the community, provide services to local lords, or receive rewards for enforcing justice â€” these services are usually arranged for by unGifted gruagachan, who interact with the general populace.</span></p>",

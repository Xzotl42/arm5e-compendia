You are a member of a </p><p><em>tariqa </em>of Sufis led by a <em>shaykh. </em>While the group supports you in times of need, your <em>shaykh </em>expects equal commitment from you to him or her and the other members; you automatically have the Minor Story Flaw Mentor, which does not yield any points for buying Virtues. See <em>Realms of Power: The Divine, Revised Edition,</em> page 116, for details of the supernatural powers wielded by some Sufis. It is also possible to be an entirely mundane Sufi, in which case you should take this Virtue as a Social Status Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most Muslims treat you with respect for your pious lifestyle. You may purchase the Abilities Theology: Islam, Islamic Law, and Dominion Lore at character creation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Virtue may be taken by both male and female characters, either as a Minor Social Status Virtue or a Minor Supernatural Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

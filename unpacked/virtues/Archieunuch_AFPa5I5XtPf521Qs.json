    "description": "<p>You have risen to enjoy the status and privilege associated with the most important and talented eunuchs, the <span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times_EmbeddedFont', 'Times_MSFontService', Times New Roman, serif\">archieunuch</span>s. Although you are not a ruler in your own right, a ruler likely depends on you to govern effectively and has thus granted you considerable authority to act in his stead. Due to this status and importance, you wield significant influence among the lesser nobility. You might serve either as a regional administrator, an important courtier, or a general, and there are numerous servants and possibly other subordinate eunuchs under your command. You have been granted a residence, either within a castle or palace, or elsewhere. Due to your education, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This social status is found in the eastern Roman empire, with its capital at Constantinople, and does not exist in western Europe or much of the Muslim world. This Virtue is only available to male characters, who must also be eunuchs.</p><p>Â </p>",

    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Many faeries have a Pretense called Faerie Speech, which they use instead of acquiring human languages. Faeries seem to know the same languages as whomever they are talking to. If speaking to a group that has demonstrated mixed linguistic skills, the faerie may select which language to speak in.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This effect occurs whenever the faerie speaks and costs no Might. It is not magically resisted, because the effect only alters the behavior of the faerie. If the faerie has not heard a person from its audience speak, it may only use whichever language it last used with humans. Once its audience speaks, the faerie may then converse in the correct language for its audience.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In the bestiary chapter, Faerie Speech is frequently given to characters designed as NPCs. Characters designed for possible use by players have this Virtue more rarely, to free up a Virtue slot, but it is still appropriate for a wide variety of faeries.</span></p>",

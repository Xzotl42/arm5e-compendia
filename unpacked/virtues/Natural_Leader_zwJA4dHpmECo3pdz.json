His self-assured manner gives him a +3 bonus to rolls in social situations in which he takes the lead; people are more likely to follow his orders or do as he suggests. If he is Gifted, this bonus can temporarily help to overcome the social penalty of The Gift, due to the strength of his domineering personality.</p><p>Â </p>",

    "description": "<p>You have the blood of angels in your veins and descend from the great </p><p>heroes of the Antediluvian Age, the Nephilim. Unless you take the Mythic Companion Virtue, your heritage is somewhat diluted, although still significant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your Size is increased to +1, and this increases by +1 for every century you are alive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may learn Dominion Lore during character creation without needing to take the Arcane Lore Minor Virtue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You age incredibly slowly, and may live for hundreds of years. You need make an aging roll only once every ten years after the age of 150, and receive a –5 to Aging Rolls. You gain no benefit from Longevity Potions or any magic or supernatural power that slows or relieves Aging or Decrepitude. Once you gain your first Decrepitude Point, it becomes increasingly difficult for you to learn new things: subtract your age ÷ 10 from all Advancement Totals, although the Advancement Total for a season cannot drop below 1.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to your great size, you must eat vast amounts of food (equal to what three normal people would eat in a day), and have the Minor Personality Flaw Greedy (which counts as one of your normal Flaws). If you go without food for even a single day you fall into a deep slumber, a kind of supernatural hibernation. You will starve to death in (2 + your Divine Might) days unless you are fed your own body weight in food. (Note that this Virtue does not itself grant Divine Might; see Strong Angelic Heritage, later.) After awakening, you suffer a number of lost Long Term Fatigue Levels equal to the number of days you went without food.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may not take The Gift or True Faith, Hermetic Virtues or Flaws, Methods or Powers (see <em>Realms of Power: The Divine, Revised Edition,</em> pages 46–56), Virtues such as Giant, Mythic, or Faerie Blood, Flaws such as Age Quickly or Lycanthrope, or Virtues or Flaws that affect your Size. A descendant of the Nephilim without Divine Might could, in theory, learn supernatural powers (other than Divine Methods and Powers) from any realm, but that is very rare. Magi and Grogs may not take this Virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

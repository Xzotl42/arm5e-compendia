    "description": "<p>You owe fealty and service to a higher noble, and control land, serfs, and men-at-arms. You have half a dozen servants at your manor house, including a couple of bodyguards. Your servants should be controlled by the rest of the troupe. You have sworn an Oath of Fealty, and so</p><p>it would be reasonable to balance this Virtue with that Flaw. You get the normal points for Oath of Fealty if you do. You are wealthier than most characters, but have no additional free time. You have the power to enforce the law within your fief, but you may not impose the death penalty, nor may you mutilate criminals. Floggings and fines are the normal penalties you impose.</p><p> </p><p>If you are Poor, your fief is either very small, or in a poor area for farming with few other resources. You must spend every season managing it, or it may collapse completely, leaving you effectively landless. You are no wealthier than most average characters, and you have only a couple of servants.</p><p> </p><p>Wealthy Landed Nobles control more than one fief, and have bailiffs or stewards for each, so that they do not need to devote any time to looking after their lands. You are significantly richer than most Wealthy characters, and could afford to build a small castle or a large chapel within a cathedral. You have around fifty servants, including a significant number of warriors.</p><p> </p><p>This Status Virtue is compatible with the <span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times_EmbeddedFont', 'Times_MSFontService', Times New Roman, serif\">Knight </span>Minor Status Virtue, but unlike that Virtue it is available to male and female characters.</p><p>Also available for Eastern Christendom </p>",

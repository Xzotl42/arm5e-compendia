The character is associated with one particular type of regio network.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once the character is in such a regio he may travel to any other regio in the network; travel time is one Diameter regardless of geographic distance. To determine whether the character knows the location of a networked regio in a particular locale an Intelligence + (Area) Lore roll is made against an Ease Factor of 9. The character knows how to enter these regiones and can, if he chooses, guide other characters into the regiones — although other characters must be able to survive in the environment of the regio.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Access to the network may be ultimately controlled by other characters or powers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>The character teaches at a cathedral school, one of the many that dot Mythic Europe. He is at least (30 â€“ Intelligence) years old and must have scores of 5 in Latin and Artes </p><p>Liberales, and a Teaching score of at least 3. He may learn any Academic Ability, and may teach it to his students. He is typically not a university man, but was instructed at a cathedral school. He receives 240 additional experience points, which may be spent on Academic Abilities and Teaching. The character has an Academic Reputation of 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Virtue is compatible with the Baccalaureus and Priest Virtues. Characters with higher university degrees should take those Virtues instead; a magister or doctor gains no additional status from teaching at a cathedral school. This Virtue is only available to male characters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

He is a member of the urban community where the university is located. He may begin play with scores in Latin or Artes Liberales, although a score of more than 1 in Artes Liberales would be rare. He may live with the students if he is unmarried, but if he has a family then he lives with them, possessing keys to the students’ housing to allow unannounced entry. It would be <em>very</em> unusual for such a character to be female, but it is not impossible.</p>",

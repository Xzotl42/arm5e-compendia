You are likely employed by a court, a lesser noble, or a covenant. It is also possible for you to pursue a career in the eastern Church, and some monasteries accepts. Due to your education, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This Virtue is only available to male characters, who must be sexually incapable, rather than simply inactive. This may be due to castration (see the Castratus Flaw), but need not be.</p>",

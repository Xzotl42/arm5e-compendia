As with the Minor General Virtue Relic, the item may be built into any other item that you possess, like a sword or a pendant. </p><p> </p><p>Owning such a powerful relic is a great responsibility, and your character should behave in an appropriate manner. If you ever behave impiously (as judged by the storyguide) your relic will cease to function until suitable penance is made.</p>",

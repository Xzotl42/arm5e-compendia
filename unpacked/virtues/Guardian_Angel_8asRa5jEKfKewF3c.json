    "description": "<p>You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. He approves of violence only when there is a holy reason</p><p> — often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel’s advice, he may leave you until you correct your ways. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, he can hear and converse with you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your guardian angel can also help in two practical ways. First, he can grant you a +5 bonus to Soak. Second, he can grant you a Magic Resistance of 15. This Magic Resistance is not compatible with a magus’s Parma Magica, or Magic Resistance from most other sources, but it does add to the Magic Resistance resulting from Faith Points (see page @@). The angel only grants you these bonuses if you are acting in accordance with God’s will.</p>",

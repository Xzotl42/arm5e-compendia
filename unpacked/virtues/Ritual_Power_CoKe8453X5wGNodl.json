    "description": "<p>The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will. This is a single power, equivalent to a Ritual Hermetic spell with a level of 25 or lower. The power has an Initiative equal to the character’s Quickness – (twice power magnitude). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 25, two Fatigue levels if its level is 26 to 50, and so on. In addition, you must spend one Confidence Point for every magnitude of the effect. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero.</p><p> </p><p>This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers or a single stronger power.</p><p> </p><p>This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as <em>Realms of Power: The Divine, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, </em>or <em>Hedge Magic Revised Edition</em>, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)</p><p> </p>",

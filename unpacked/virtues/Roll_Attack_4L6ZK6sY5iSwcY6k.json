    "description": "<p>: when the creature has successfully bitten a foe, it may roll in the following round. When the creature rolls, it either twists away a chunk of the flesh of its victim (doing +6 damage) or, if possible, drags its victim beneath the surface of the water. To prevent injury or submersion from a roll, the victim must treat this as a successful grappling attack with an Attack Advantage of 10. If a character is being drowned by the creature, the character may attempt to break free of the creatures jaws each round. This requires the character to overcome a successful Grapple attack with an Attack Advantage of 10.</p>",

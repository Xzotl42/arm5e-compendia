    "description": "<p>This Virtue is only available to a character who can take the form of a bird (which may be her natural form). She can painlessly separate a feather from her body, and use it to write as a quill, controlling its movements telepathically while it remains within Sight. The quill doesnâ€™t need ink; it provides it magically. After she finishes writing, the character can reattach the feather if in bird form. The quality of the character as a scribe does not differ between human and bird forms. The character can also pull off feathers in bird form, turn into a human, and still mentally control the dropped feathers.</p><p>This Virtue is particularly associated with a north African magical tradition called the Daughters of Four Fathers (see <em>Between Sand & Sea,</em> page 107).</p>",

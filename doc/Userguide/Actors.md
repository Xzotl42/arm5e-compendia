There are different types of **Actors** that can be created:

Their sheets have been color coded for convenience, as well, so you can tell at a glance what they are.

- [[Beast]]: a beast, whether magical or mundane, coded in brown. Their sheets are very similar to a Player Character's one, for now;
- [[Covenants:]] the "extra character" of the saga, where the PCs and many NPCs live, coded in red;
- [[Laboratories]]: for a magus to work, they need a laboratory, of course. These are coded in green;
- [[Magic Codex:]] a place where you can find a lot of information, such as base levels for spells, shape and material bonuses, for instance, as well as somewhere to experiment with creating and saving effects for later use, coded in violet;
- NPCs: the Non-Player Characters, that is, everybody else, basically, which are coded in brown. The fields in their sheets are pretty much like the Player Character's so they're not explained twice. This Actor will also undergo an overhaul in the future;
- [[Player Characters]]: the PCs, belonging to the players, which are coded in blue.

If you're still following, we recommend you check [[Player Characters]] next.

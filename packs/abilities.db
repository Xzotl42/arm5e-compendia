Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

It enables the character to heal diseases, remove curses, and dispel detrimental magical effects, but only by transferring (or 'throwing') their effects to another person. Curse-Throwing cannot affect Flaws; specifically, someone with the Lesser or Greater Malediction Flaw is beyond the power of Curse-Throwing, unless it is a Flaw imposed by a faerie or magician with a limited duration. However, any other curse laid by a supernatural power is potentially within the remit of this Ability; note that curses laid directly by God (such as leprosy) are normally represented by permanent Flaws, and thus exempt. Only harmful effects can be transferred with this Ability, and the storyguide is the arbiter in cases where spells are not directly detrimental. Barrenness is a common affliction treated by this power; if transferred to a man or male animal then impotence is inflicted instead. Other curses transferred to inappropriate targets are changed in a similar manner.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">To throw a curse, the afflicted person must be physically present, and the recipient of the curse must be represented either in person or by an Arcane Connection. Afflictions can be passed from humans to animals or vice versa, but this is harder than transferring within the same species. Curse-Throwers sometimes transfer the curse to themselves, but such altruism is rare. To throw a curse, the character must perform an elaborate ritual which involves the crafting of a charm which transfers the curse. This charm is a combination of a physical object and a chant. The object is repeatedly touched to the target and the recipient (or the Arcane Connection), whilst the chant is repeated over and over. The ritual typically takes an hour for every 5 points (or fraction) of the Ease Factor (see below). At the end of this time, the character generates a Casting Total, which must equal or exceed the Ease Factor listed below. If either the sufferer or the intended recipient of the curse has Magic Resistance, the Penetration Total must exceed it, else the curse stays where it is. A botched Curse-Throwing roll swaps the recipient of the curse to the caster.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Curse-Throwing Casting Total: Presence + Curse-Throwing + Aura + stress die</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Penetration Total: Casting Total – Ease Factor + Penetration Bonus</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th dir=\"ltr\">Curse</th><th dir=\"ltr\">Ease Factor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Minor Disease or Affliction*</td><td dir=\"auto\">9</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Serious Disease or Affliction*</td><td dir=\"auto\">12</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Major Disease or Affliction*</td><td dir=\"auto\">15</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Critical Disease *</td><td dir=\"auto\">18</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Spell</td><td dir=\"ltr\">12 + magnitude of spell</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Supernatural Ability</td><td dir=\"ltr\">12 + Ability score</td></tr><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Power</td><td dir=\"ltr\">12 + Might points spent</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">*a Minor disease inflicts a Light wound, a Serious disease inflicts a Medium wound, a Major disease inflicts a Heavy wound, and a Critical disease inflicts an Incapacitating wound.

The ritual takes three hours, at the end of which, Aelfred generates a Casting Total: 2 (Presence) + 5 (Curse-Throwing) + 5 (stress die) + 2 (Faerie aura of Aelfred's home), for a total of 14. However, unbeknownst to the characters the barrenness was caused by the curse of a local witch. Her Hex Ability score was 5, thus the Ease Factor was actually 17 (12 + Hex 5). Since Aelfred's player succeeds in an Intelligence + Faerie Lore roll, the storyguide informs him that Aelfred suspects that his Curse-Throwing should have worked if the barrenness was natural.

This hostility can range from simple antagonism to murder. Through simple conversation, the speaker makes the listener dislike, resent, or hate a person formerly considered a friend. The conversation does not have to be long; a round is time enough for this effect to take place.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">To embitter a target, the player states the exact specifications of how the target will act against the intended victim. He then rolls the character's Communication + Embitterment + a stress die and compares it to a variable Ease Factor, which depends on the level of aggression he wishes to instill, and the level of loyalty possessed between the target and the former ally. Since this is a Supernatural Ability, the roll always uses a stress die. The Embitterment power of the Nemthengacha is a Magic power for purposes of determining its interaction with the other realms of power; it seems likely that an Infernal version also exists.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\"><strong>Embitterment Roll: Communication + Embitterment + stress die</strong></span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Consult the following chart to determine the Ease Factor.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Ease Factor</span></th><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Desired Effect</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">6</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Turn a man against his neighbor, business partner, or co-worker</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">9</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Turn a man against his wife, friend, or cousin (distant kin)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">12</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Turn a man against his kin (father, brother, and nuclear family)</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">15</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Turn a man against his lord</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">18</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Turn a man against his king</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">The base effect makes the victim dislike the target, leading to slander, resentment, and a refusal to cooperate with him. Increasing this animosity to hatred adds +3 to the Ease Factor. Victims made to hate the indicated target desire to do some kind of harm to him, but stop short of killing the person. Such a person would destroy someone's fields, ruin a business opportunity, wreck their marriage, or perhaps wound them in a duel. Increasing hatred to loathing adds another +3 to the Ease Factor (+6 in total), and makes the victim try to slay the intended target. For example, the Ease Factor is 18 to embitter a man to commit patricide (base 12 + 6), and 24 to commit regicide (base 18 + 6).</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">The Range of embitterment is Voice and the Target is always Individual. The Duration is Sun, although this can be increased to Moon by increasing Ease Factor by +3. Because embitterment acts through conversation, the caster must speak a language that the target comprehends.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">A character so embittered cannot disobey the command. He is not allowed a Loyalty roll to see if he can ignore the emotional summons, or other quibbling based on the character's Personality Traits. Hermetic magic can cancel the embitterment with a Perdo Vim spell. Rego Mentem magic can replace the feelings of animosity with feelings of loyalty or compassion, Creo Mentem can create feelings of loyalty that supersede the effect, and Perdo Mentem could erase the feelings of animosity. To determine how powerful a Hermetic spell needs to be, consider the effective level of the embitterment to be equal to the Nemthenga's score in Embitterment times five.</span></p></div>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"indexKey":"embitterment","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","defaultChaAb":"com","speciality":"","xp":0,"accelerated":false,"key":"supernatural","option":"Embitterment","realm":"magic","optionLinked":false},"effects":[],"folder":"ZbCET9zUtDWzYD5z","ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1731079323467,"modifiedTime":1731255710940,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM"},"_id":"LRjGpTaM9sMoHUoj","sort":500000}

Small cults may fade away from lack of members, especially if they are persecuted at some point — but if they committed some of their Lore to writing, the cult may be re-born by those who discover and understand the texts. Some cults risk the loss of secrecy for this very reason — that their secrets and magical rites may not be lost forever.

A labyrinth meditation is a non-magical ritual during which the magus walks slowly through a maze while contemplating a problem. Many contemplation mazes are simple ribbons, with a single path leading to a center, then out again. Simple contemplative labyrinths can be created with low-level spells.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus&rsquo;s mental state remains focused for an hour after he completes the labyrinth. This allows a bonus on a single roll. This can be used to untangle a single conundrum (an Enigmatic Wisdom roll), recall a single fact (a Lore roll), or perform a single physical action. Physical actions must take no longer than one minute (ten combat rounds). The bonus is equal to half the magus&rsquo;s Enigmatic Wisdom score.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus must have a score of at least one in the required Ability before it can be assisted by labyrinth meditations. Meditations add grace to the magus&rsquo;s thoughts and actions, but do not grant conscious skill. A magus who does not know how to swim, for example, cannot use the clarity of thought and action provided by the meditation to swim.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">Characters with an Enigmatic Wisdom score of three or more don&rsquo;t need a physical labyrinth; they can walk in a circle for the same effect. Those with a score of six or more don&rsquo;t even need to walk &mdash; they can imagine the circle. Labyrinth rituals take sixteen hours for characters with a score of one in Enigmatic Wisdom. The time required halves for each level they gain. Characters with brief meditation times cannot, however, perform several meditations and save or stack the bonuses.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 6pt; text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Twilight</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">Criamon magi understand Twilight better than other magi, and so navigate it more safely.

A character who summons a wind at a particular strength can change that wind to another type with a similar strength (such as from <em>Circular Winds of Protection</em> to <em>Broom of the Winds</em>), diminish it to a weaker effect (such as <em>Chamber of Spring Breezes</em>), or end it entirely. Each of these changes requires a Communication + Music roll, using the Ease Factors for Maintaining Concentration on a spell (page @@). Whistling a new tune in this manner cannot increase the strength of a wind, or return a diminished wind to its former intensity; instead the character must make a new Whistle Up The Wind roll. All effects of this Ability diminish to the next lowest level of strength once every 24 hours, when the sun sets, until they dwindle to nothing.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Ease Factor</span></th><th dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Strength of Wind</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">6</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Light breeze, strong enough to clear a stench from a room</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">9</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Moderate wind, strong enough to affect the accuracy of arrows</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">12</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Strong wind, powerful enough to propel a sailing ship</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">15</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Gale force wind, strong enough to knock someone over</span></td></tr><tr><td dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">18</span></td><td dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Hurricane force wind, strong enough to uproot trees</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\"><strong>Specialities</strong>: at sea, in mountains, during the winter (Supernatural)</span></p></div>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"indexKey":"whistle-up-the-wind","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","defaultChaAb":"sta","speciality":"","xp":0,"accelerated":false,"key":"supernatural","option":"WhistleUpTheWind","realm":"magic","optionLinked":false},"effects":[],"folder":"ZbCET9zUtDWzYD5z","ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1731132370296,"modifiedTime":1731255710944,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM"},"_id":"ZeXibGVqQaGGlwRI","sort":0}

Many Mystery Cult specialty books also require a score in this ability to decode their heavy symbolism; this method is used to prevent un-Initiated outsiders learning secrets of the Mystery.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Mystery Cult Lore also covers the ceremonies of the cult, frequently enacted whenever the cult gathers formally. It is also a key knowledge for a Mystagogue's performance of the Initiation Rites, to guide the Initiate through the path of Ordeals, ceremony and meditation, to gain new Virtues.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Cult Lore is passed from Mystagogue to Initiate, from Mystae to Mystae in a chain of living secrets. Some cults also write down their secret lores, as this codifies the Mystery and lets others share the same view of the cult — others prefer the secrecy of the Oral Tradition. Small cults may fade away from lack of members, especially if they are persecuted at some point — but if they committed some of their Lore to writing, the cult may be re-born by those who discover and understand the texts. Some cults risk the loss of secrecy for this very reason — that their secrets and magical rites may not be lost forever. Some magi search for lost texts, containing secret lores of the Ancients, hoping to re-enact the rites and rituals that led the Ancients to power.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">In game terms, Experience points in Cult Lore are acquired like any other knowledge — including Teaching, Books, Practice and Exposure. Learning Cult Lore from another ensures that master and pupil share the same rites; learning by yourself generally implies that you have devised your own variant (even \"deviant\") rites and rituals — from such disagreements schisms arise and cults may break up and fragment.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">A magus may build the knowledge from 0, even without instruction — but this means they have devised their own cult, and should treat their Lore as a new Lore.

This is usually an animal&nbsp;or bird, but it can be a plant. The heartbeast is&nbsp;always a living thing, and usually a noble creature.&nbsp;No known magus has had an earthworm&nbsp;heartbeast, for example. A maga&rsquo;s heartbeast displays a central aspect of her nature, so that her personality, even in human form, will&nbsp;resemble that of the creature. Initiates of the&nbsp;Bjornaer mystery gain the Ability Heartbeast.&nbsp;This Ability cannot be gained by any character&nbsp;who has not been initiated into the mystery. For initiates of the Outer Mystery, the&nbsp;Heartbeast Ability is only used when something&nbsp;tries to stop the magus changing forms.&nbsp;In that case, a roll of Stamina + Heartbeast&nbsp;against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide&nbsp;allows the character to change anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Bjornaer maga can only change into&nbsp;one kind of animal, and that kind cannot be&nbsp;altered by Hermetic magic. The transformed Bjornaer can be changed, by Muto Animal magic, for example, but the kind of animal that&nbsp;her heartbeast is cannot be changed. A Bjornaer maga really is her heartbeast, and so remaining in that form does not count as being&nbsp;under an active mystical effect (see &ldquo;Warping,&ldquo;&nbsp;page 167). Of course, she is really human as&nbsp;well, so remaining human does not cause warping&nbsp;either. Hermetic magic is unable to tell whether an animal is actually a Bjornaer, and&nbsp;the same applies to most other kinds of magic.&nbsp;(This assumes that the maga is trying to hide&nbsp;her nature, of course.) As a result, a Bjornaer in&nbsp;animal form is affected by Animal spells, not&nbsp;Corpus or Mentem spells. Spells already in&nbsp;effect before the transformation remain in&nbsp;effect, however.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi can cast spells while in the&nbsp;form of their heartbeast, but they cannot speak&nbsp;or make the appropriate gestures, and thus normally&nbsp;take a &ndash;15 penalty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The transformation takes only a moment,&nbsp;and affects only the maga. None of her possessions are transformed. A Bjornaer who has been&nbsp;physically changed by magic may try to assume&nbsp;her normal form or her heartbeast form. She&nbsp;must roll Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease&nbsp;Factor set by the storyguide. As a rule of&nbsp;thumb, 3 + the magnitude of the transforming magic is a reasonable number. If she does&nbsp;resume one of her natural forms, the other&nbsp;magic is dispelled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi do not treat physical transformations&nbsp;as major magical effects for the purposes&nbsp;of gaining Warping Points. However, a&nbsp;magical transformation which is maintained&nbsp;over time will grant one Warping Point per&nbsp;year, as it is still a continuing mystical effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, Bjornaer magi cannot bind familiars.&nbsp;The reasons for this are debated, but the&nbsp;fact is uncontroversial.</p>","source":"ArM5","page":0,"defaultChaAb":"int","speciality":"","xp":0,"key":"heartbeast","option":"","realm":"magic","indexKey":"heartbeast","reviewer":"xzotl","review_status":"reviewed","optionLinked":false},"_stats":{"systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","coreVersion":"12.331","createdTime":1662235751918,"modifiedTime":1731255710947,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null},"folder":"Ku86xoVh78FXIgLr","_id":"kbS3M30Ahcmy3KUu","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"1JBSgWiiwizu7vru":3}}

{"name":"Sense Passions","type":"ability","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/abilities/sensePassions.svg","system":{"description":"<div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character can sense the personality and desires of an intelligent being by recognizing and identifying the different shades of tarnish on its soul. A Perception + Sense Passions roll against an Ease Factor of 9 lets her sense the most powerful emotion currently being experienced by the person, and a roll against an Ease Factor of 15 allows her to identify the character's most dominant Personality Trait. The effect must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance if it has any kind of supernatural protection, and since this is a Supernatural Ability, it is affected by auras.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Sense Passions: stress die + Perception + Sense Passions + Aura</strong></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Through careful examination, the character can also recognize passions in people within the general area, allowing her to hone in on the most powerful source of emotion within sight, usually the character with the highest (or lowest) Personality Trait. This requires a 12 or better on the Sense Passions roll.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The character can also tell when an aura has a tarnish (se <em>Realms of Power: The Infernal,</em> page 13<em>)</em> or temper (see <em>Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition</em>, page 38) and its type or types by overcoming an Ease Factor of 6.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">By sensing passions, the character can often recognize incorporeal spirits. You may treat Sense Passions as Second Sight when attempting to recognize the presence of invisible or bodiless beings. However, this does not allow her to see through illusions, even illusions of strong emotions, and she cannot actually see the spirits, merely sense their proximity.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">In addition, this Ability allows the character to Sense Holiness and Unholiness in a limited fashion, much like the Sense Holiness and Unholiness Ability. She can tell that something is either holy or unholy, but she cannot distinguish between the two. She feels the emotional presence associated with the Divine or the Infernal, but cannot pinpoint its supernatural origin. Thus, she might mistake a demon with a fair shape for an angel, or a fearsome-looking angel for a demon. By identifying the target's primary emotions or desires, however, you can usually get a good idea of which realm the target is associated with, assuming the character can penetrate its Magic Resistance.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Sense Passions is either a false power (see the False Power Flaw), or is associated with the Infernal. This means that it always appears infernal to divine or infernal detection. The presence of Infernal taint allows the Sense Holiness and Unholiness aspect to work. If the troupe allows Divine powers to be false, this may be the false version of Sense Holiness and Unholiness. </p><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Specialties</strong>: auras, emotions, Personality Traits, in a general area.

There are three ways for her to activate this power: by making eye contact with her victim and proclaiming her purpose loud enough for him to hear, by tracing temporary occult signs and symbols on her target that indicate the dark fate she intends, or by acquiring an Arcane Connection to her target and fashioning a recognizable representation that can channel the effect through sympathetic magic.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">To hex a target, the character must make clear her will for it: she must declare her wishes to the victim aloud, or indicate the specifics of the hex in writing on or very near the target, or do something to the representation that is similar to what she intends to happen to the target. There is always a physical component to the hex (common practices include tying knots in a line, spitting, or giving the target the \"evil eye\").</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">You must also state a time frame for the hex, anywhere from an effect that occurs immediately to a hex that will affect the third generation of the victim's descendants. Generally speaking, the sooner the effect manifests, the less potent it will be; and the longer the hex delays, the more powerful it will eventually become. For this reason you must always apply the delay modifier (see the sidebar) to the Hex total.</p></div><div class=\"el-table\" style=\"overflow-x: auto;\" dir=\"ltr\"><table><thead><tr><th dir=\"ltr\">Hex Delay Modifiers</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td dir=\"ltr\">Delay</td><td>Modifier</td></tr><tr><td>moment</td><td>–12</td></tr><tr><td>hour</td><td>–9</td></tr><tr><td>day</td><td>–6</td></tr><tr><td>week</td><td>–3</td></tr><tr><td>month</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>season</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>year</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>generation</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>lifetime</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">When you have framed the hex appropriately, roll Intelligence + Hex + aura bonus + the delay modifier and compare this to the Ease Factor on the Hex Effects chart.

If you should botch the Hex roll, the hex may still happen, but with unpredictable and unintended results, possibly affecting the character or someone close to her instead.

If a character receives absolution in a religious ceremony, all hexes that have targeted him are permanently undone. Characters can also remove hexes with other supernatural effects, such as a Perdo Vim spell, a faerie blessing, or a holy miracle. Treat the hex as having a spell level equal to the number of botch dice it approximates, multiplied by 10, so that a Serious hex is a level 20 effect, and a Critical hex is level 40.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Hex is often a false power (as the False Power Flaw) associated with the Magical or Faerie realms. That is, it often uses the Magical or Faerie column of the realm interaction chart, but appears as an unholy power when subjected to divine or infernal powers of investigation.

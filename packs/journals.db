The character sheets should be familiar to Ars Magica players as most fields are self explanatory and their sheets are very similar. They increase in complexity from grog to companion to magus. Please see below for a more in-depth explanation of each feature of the sheet.\n\nWhenever you see a die icon, click it to roll. A pop up will open to confirm some details and actually roll.\n\nFor brevity, we will limit ourselves to describing only items that need some sort of explanation or that function differently than a simple \"type your info here\".\n\n\n# **Magi, Companions and Grogs**    \n\n\n#### *Please note: for most of the sheet, right-clicking on an item will show its full description in the sheet without opening an extra window*\n\n\n## Header\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/CreationModeIcon.webp)\n**Creation mode icon:** Indicates this **Actor** is in creation mode. Right now, it has only the following effects (with more to come):\n\t- Normal mode: You can change the **Year born** field and have the system set the **Actor's** age;\n\t- Creation mode: You set the age of the **Actor** and the system sets the birth year based on the current time\n\nThis setting can be changed in the @UUID[JournalEntry.DFjCqKKYuQfINC53.JournalEntryPage.f4XgRVlAs6tcT9Np]{Player Characters}, below.\n\n**Covenant field:** Set it to an existing covenant name in the world to link it to that character - the character will automatically become a member in the covenant sheet. Or you can click on the link symbol to open the covenant sheet. You can also drag and drop a covenant actor on the character sheet for the same effect. A covenant needs to be created as an Actor, that is, just like a Player Character. Please see @UUID[JournalEntry.iHR7gqUM72834zbe.JournalEntryPage.nGUtWRxN0YFK9vLA]{Covenant}.\n\n**Season** and **Year** cannot be changed by hand - they're automatically set by the system. Changing your character's age will also changed their year of birth, further down the sheet.\n\n**Characteristics:** \nClick on a characteristic label to open a roll dialog. Mousing over the score will also tell you the number of aging points in that characteristic - the more aging points, the larger a shadow will appear around the field. To edit the aging points, shift+click the label of the characteristic.\n  \n## Description\n\nSome fields like **size**, **soak** and **encumbrance** are read only because they are automatically computed by the system and can only be changed through @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects};\n\n**Warping**: Clicking on the Twilight icon will trigger a Twilight episode, as will getting two or more points of Warping when casting a spell (though the threshold can be adjusted with @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects}). See @UUID[JournalEntry.s7P6sBEiErRHujDK.JournalEntryPage.0STrpU7HOLgDFB0G]{Twilight};\n\n**Aging and decrepitude**: Click on the little hourglass icon to do an aging roll (see @UUID[JournalEntry.fCfU8W7PVHRKiFR1.JournalEntryPage.YVHrFeULB7NMF1HJ]{Aging});\n\n**Personaliy traits:** Click on the + sign to add a Personality Trait. Click on the die icon to roll for it;\n\n**Reputation**: Click on the + sign to add a Reputation. Click on the die icon to roll for it.\n\n### Vitals and Combat\n\n**Fatigue**: Use the + and - signs to increase your fatigue or the rest button to reset it all. Spell casting will automatically add fatigue levels as well, which is taken into account for all necessary rolls.\n\nIt is also possible to increase or decrease your fatigue levels and the associated penalty using @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects}.\n\n**Wounds:** You can manually add wounds to a character here. Each wound is individually represented by an icon and fresh wounds have a red aura around them.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/Wounds.webp)\n*Wounds*\n\nClicking the wound icon opens a pop up where you can add more information about the wound, such as location, for instance. It will also allow you to delete the wound. Deleting the wound is *not* the same as recovering from it and will just remove it altogether!\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/WoundWindow.webp)\n*Wound window*\n\nClicking the bandaged hand opens the @UUID[JournalEntry.0dVWcwwAtCN2OSzi.JournalEntryPage.jNitArmdrlr5LMgP]{Sanatorium} window. In this window not only can you roll for recovery, it will also keep a record of the rolls and effects. Please see the corresponding page for more details on how it works.\n\nThe penalties for wounds and fatigue are automatically taken into account for rolls - remember that if you're casting a lot of spells and rest for a while you need to come back here and remove those fatigue levels.\n\n**Combat section:** You can roll for initiative, attack, defense etc here (See @UUID[JournalEntry.WkiiKUYPxb2Ejz6M.JournalEntryPage.kKpjC3VOZpoUxPiJ]{Combat} for more detail). Please note you can't change any numbers here - they're derived from other places, such as your stats, items and so on.\n\n**Weapons and Armor**: A duplicate from the Inventory tab put here for convenience. Click on the check box to equip or unequip. Dragging and dropping items here will also work, of course, as will adding them manually by clicking on the + icon. You can edit them here, like you can in the [[Inventory]] tab.\n\n## Abilities\n\nThis section lists all the abilities possessed by the character. As mentioned in the Introduction, you can add preconfigured abilities by dragging and dropping from the sidebar, from a Compendium or even from another character sheet.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/AbilitiesActor.webp)\n\nYou can also click the little + icon to add an ability that will be specific to this character only. Creating it here and then dragging and dropping it back into the Items tab will add that new ability to the Items available.\n\nSimply click on the Ability label to roll for it. A pop up window will ask for the specific conditions to the roll (like Characteristic to be used, simple/stress die etc).\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/AbilityRoll.webp)\n*Ability roll window*\n\nThe abilities are arranged alphabetically in different sections corresponding to their category in the Core book (General, Academic etc).\n\nA category will appear only if the character has an ability in it, however. Clicking on a category will collapse or expand the corresponding list of abilities.\n\nActive effects are represented by colors:\n\n* Blue: Puissant\n\n* Red: Affinity\n\n* Violet: Puissant and affinity\n\n* Dark grey blue: Deficiency\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/AbilitiesActorEffects.webp)\n*Active effects*\n\n### Virtues and Flaws\n\nAs with abilities, you can drag and drop Virtues and Flaws, as well as create new ones here and drag them back to the Items tab. A label in _italic_ means it has an Active Effect, that is, it affects something else in the sheet (like an Ability, for instance).\n\n## Arts\n\nThis tab is only available to magic users.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/HermeticArts.webp)\n\nEach of the Arts is represented in this section:\n\n-   The Art symbol or its hand gesture (see @UUID[JournalEntry.AYlByKlrOc3BuHOG.JournalEntryPage.WwcmJz7FCM5GKVJq]{Settings});\n\n-   Its name - click on it to roll for spontaneous magic and follow the prompts in the pop up window;\n   \n-   The amount of XP spent in it and the total needed for the next level. You can directly edit the amount of XP here;\n\n-   The score, read only but adjustable with the plus and minus icons. Please note changing the score will also change the amount of XP in the previous box to the amount necessary for the level, ignoring whatever you added before. Changing it back will not remember the last number set there;\n\n-   The forms have an additional number between braces: this is the magic resistance for this form (ie: 5x Parma Magica + score);\n\n-   The same colored shadow codes as abilities are used to indicate an active effect:\n\n   -   Blue: Puissant\n\n   -   Red: Affinity\n\n   -   Violet: Puissant and affinity\n   \n   -   Dark grey blue: Deficiency\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/SpontaneousCasting.webp)\n  *Spontaneous casting window*\n\n#### Voice and gestures\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/VoiceGestures.webp)\n\nYou can configure the default casting modifiers here. Whenever you cast a spell, whether formulaic or through a spontaneous casting effect, these settings will affect that roll.\n\n#### Magic totals\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/MagicTotals.webp)\n\nA list of totals used for magic computed with characteristics and abilities. None of these are directly editable, being derived numbers.\n\nYou can, however, directly roll fast-casting and targeting by clicking on the corresponding labels.\n\n#### Spells\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/SpellList.webp)\n\nAs it is for abilities, a list of the spells known by the magus. And just as with abilities, these can be created here, added through drag and drop from the Items tab, or created here and then dragged back to the Item tab, adding them to the general item list.\n\nPlease see [[Creating new spells and effects]] for more details on how to create these.\n\nAlso note the little icon next to the spell name - that icon denotes a specific Mastery for that spell - Fast Casting, in this example. Hovering the mouse over the icon will bring up what it means.\n\nClick on a spell to roll for casting. That will open a pop up window asking for more details. Remember the Voice and Gestures choices *will* affect this roll (and do show up under \"Bonuses\" in the new window and in the result dialogue).\n\nClicking on the up-down arrow icon will display a special filter area:\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/SpellFilter.webp)\n*Spell filter*\n\nYou can filter by technique, form and level and then close it. A red aura around the word \"Filter\" will indicate the list is filtered.\n\nPlease note the filter parameters are stored in the browser on a per user and character basis so two different users can have their own specific view of the same sheet at the same time. As long as you keep using the same tab they will be preserved.\n\n#### Spontaneous magical effects\n\nSame as spell list, but for frequently used spontaneous effects. Please [[Creating new spells and effects]] for more details on adding these.\n\n### Casting totals\n\nThis table gives you a quick overview of the magical capabilities of a character and is only for reference.\nApplying a magical focus, changing the aura level, changing the Divider or the Modifier here will only show you the effects such an actual change would have and do not affect actual casting or lab totals at all.\n\n## Laboratory\n\nA laboratory or sanctum needs to be created as an Actor, just like a Player Character. Please see [[Laboratory]].\n\nJust below that line, you have the same totals you had in Arts, and, like in Arts, they're for reference mostly, though you can click on Fast Casting Speed and Targeting to roll them from here.\n\n**Twilight Scars**: This is an editable field that is pretty self explanatory, but will also be modified in the future.\n\n**Familiar**: For now, the Familiar tab is very simple, though, and mostly for reference. It will be expanded in the future.\n\n### Lab totals\n\nSimilar to casting totals, this table gives an overview of the lab capabilities of a character. The table is not directly editable, being calculated from other fields in the sheet.\n\nPlease be aware **Laboratory quality** is a read-only field if there's a sanctum linked to the character, and the same for the aura. **Modifier** and **Apply magical focus** can be changed, however.\n\n##### Laboratory help\n\nSimply enter the stats of the magus's assistant here. This part will also be expanded later.\n\n## Inventory\n\nPretty self explanatory in general. A lot of it is drag and drop already, and new items can be created following the same rules already explained.\n\nPlease remember to equip or unequip whatever armor or weapon the character is using so these values are used for combat! To equip or unequip something, simply click on the \"Equipped:\" checkbox.\n\n### Library\n\nThis section reflects the character's library and not the covenant's one. Books are split into the following types:\n\n- Hermetic Arts\n- Abilities\n- Spell Masteries\n- Lab Texts\n- Physical Books\n\nFor more information on adding books, please see [[Libraries]].\n  \n### Diary\n\nThe diary tab lists all diary entries in ante-chronological order and will be populated from different sources. Adding equipment, for instance, twilight episodes, recovery in the sanatorium and others create entries here automatically, which can also be edited.\n\nTo add an activity here that is not controlled by another section, click the *+ Create* button and see @UUID[JournalEntry.fCfU8W7PVHRKiFR1.JournalEntryPage.YVHrFeULB7NMF1HJ]{Long term activities}. \n\nDepending on the activity, XP must be applied. If that is the case, but the activity and its XP hasn't been finalized yet, the entry will be in *italics*.\n\n- The *Pending Experience* field shows how much total experience hasn't been applied to the character yet\n\n- The Astrolabe icon opens up the calendar with the seasons and the years showing a complete list of past diary entries. Clicking on an activity will open its full entry. New activities can also be added through here, by clicking on the appropriate square for the season and year. Please see @UUID[JournalEntry.fCfU8W7PVHRKiFR1.JournalEntryPage.YVHrFeULB7NMF1HJ]{Long term activities}.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/Diary.webp)\n*Diary tab*\n\n### Effects\n\nThis tab lists all the effects currently affecting this **Actor** (including covenants) and is read-only for players.\n\n- Hovering the mouse pointer over the icon will bring up its description;\n\n- Items can be turned on and off (that is, made active or inactive) by clicking on the little X to its right. Once it's moved to the **Inactive effects** zone, it can be turned back on by clicking on the little check mark;\n\n- Some effects are brought in automatically as certain characteristics are added, like Virtues and Flaws, for example, but others must be added manually;\n\t- Please note not all Virtues, Flaws etc are adding all the effects at this time (2025/03/08). These are still being added. Please check if all the effects you need are here.\n\n- Temporary effects caused by spells will eventually also be listed here;\n\n- The **Source** field lists where the effect is coming from, of course. If the source is the name of the **Actor**, this means it was added manually to this Actor only;\n\n- To add a new effect, click the *+ Create* icon and see @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects} for more details on each kind of effect available.\n\n- **Dev note:** In Foundry core, the name for this feature is Active effects but they can be Active, Passive or Inactive which can make things confusing.\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/ActorEffects.webp)\n*Actor effects tab*\n\n### Actor settings, or the gear icon\n\nIn this tab you can change between Creation and Normal modes by clicking on the **Creation mode** checkbox. Right now, Creation mode only has the following effects, but will be expanded later:\n\n- Normal mode: You can change the **Year born** field and have the system set the **Actor's** age, in the Description.Description tab;\n- Creation mode: You can set the age of the **Actor** (in the Header section) and the system sets the birth year based on the current time\n\nThis is also a good spot to quickly add \"packages\" of stats. Please see below for details on each \"package\". \n\nPlease be aware the buttons will only add the stats, not remove them, and that adding one more package doesn't exclude the previous one. Shift+Click, however, will add 5 XP to all the related abilities (nifty for quick creation):\n\n- Add basic abilities: (Area) Lore 1, Language 5\n- Martial: Awareness 0, Brawl 0, Bows 0, Great Weapon 0, Single Weapon 0, Thrown Weapon 0\n- Social: Carouse 0, Charm 0, Etiquette 0, Folk Ken 0, Leadership 0, Bows 0\n- Rogue: Awareness 0, Charm 0, Folk Ken 0, Guile 0, Intrigue 0, Legerdemain 0\n- Mundane scholar: (no effect for now)\n- Arcane scholar: Profession: Scribe 0, Artes LIberales 0, Language: Latin 0, Philosophiae 0, Dominion Lore 0, Faerie Lore 0, Infernal Lore 0, Magic Lore 0\n- Magus: *The Gift*, Awareness 0, Concentration 0, Artes Liberales 1, Language: Latin 4, Philosophiae 0, Code of Hermes 0, Finesse 0, Magic Theory 3, Parma Magica 1, Penetration 0\n- Arts mastery: Adds 5 XP to each Art the Actor has\n\n\n\nFrom here, perhaps @UUID[JournalEntry.WkiiKUYPxb2Ejz6M.JournalEntryPage.kKpjC3VOZpoUxPiJ]{Gameplay} would be a good idea.","format":2,"content":"<p>The traditional troupe members of a Saga.

Easy way to add a bunch of abilities, virtues and flaws to a character at creation. \n\n**Game metadata:** Since the description cannot be made available for copyright reasons, most Item types available in the system Compendium are provided with the name of the sourcebook they are coming from and the page they can be found (English edition). Their display is managed by a setting (see @UUID[JournalEntry.AYlByKlrOc3BuHOG.JournalEntryPage.WwcmJz7FCM5GKVJq]{Settings})\n\nA some of Item's types don't make sense for some Actor types (eg:Ability on a Covenant), they will be filtered and ignored.\n\n## Abilities\n\nBeside the name, speciality and description, the following fields are available. A * indicates this field is only visible when it is owned.\n\n  \n**Name:** A note of the name: it can be whatever you want, in the language you want. The system doesn't care about it. (see Ability key below).\n\n**Score**: it can either be adjusted using the plus and minus signs or by directly inputting the experience amount.\n\n**Default characteristic:** This selects the characteristic used by default when you roll that ability\n\n**Ability key:** This is an **important** information for the system. It allows it to know which ability it is independently of its name. This permits the system to do a lot of things:\n\n-   Check if a character has a specific ability and its score\n    \n-   Automatically use an ability's score to implement some rules or compute some value (eg: Parma Magica, penetration).\n    \n-   Know which ability to progress during a long term activity\n    \n-   And more as the system evolves\n    \n\n**In short, if you don't configure it properly, some features won't work.**  \n\n**Ability option:** This field is greyed out most of the time, except for generic abilities. See below\n\n**Active effects on abilities**\n\nAbilities modified by an active effect have a coloured halo\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/EffectsOnAbilities.webp)\n\nPuissant ability\n\n  \n\n  \n\nAffinity with ability\n\n  \n\n  \n\nAffinity with ability and puissant ability\n\n  \n\n### Generic abilities\n\n-   Area lore, Organization lore, Languages (Dead or not), Craft, Profession, Mystery cult lore and supernatural power are generic abilities. They require an additional parameter to be recognized by the system, because there could be any number of them. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to differentiate them.\n    \n-   Each generic ability with a different Ability option is totally independent of the others. It has its own speciality an default characteristic on rolls.\n    \n-   Generic abilities in Compendia should already have their option set (eg: Dead language (Latin) has \"Latin\" in its ability option).\n    \n-   The ability option is particularly useful when you want to add an affinity or puissant ability virtue. If you have multiple instance of an ability (eg: leatherwork and glassblowing, both craft abilities), using the option will allow to pick the correct one.\n    \n-   **Important**: only alphanumeric characters are allowed for an ability option. The system will automatically remove other characters. Use CamelCase if you want to put multiple words.\n    \n\n## Virtues and Flaws\n\n**Type**: Some Actors will only accept virtues and flaws of a certain type.\n\n**Impact**: only used to keep track of how many points are used at character creation.\n\n**Description:** Usually empty (see FAQ), but in some cases there are active effects (see below) that need \"to be configured\". Look for that text before adding it.\n\n### Effects:\n\nVirtues and flaws can have active effects which will be transmitted to their owner (see @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects}). Whenever possible, those are already configured in the system Compendia (eg: the Large virtue will give +1 size).\n\n**Important:** Before V11, due to a Foundry core's limitation, it is not possible to edit active effects of an owned Item. You must edit it first in the sidebar. It is particularly relevant for effects that need configuration like Affinity, Puissant art, etc.\n\n### Personality traits and reputations\n\nYou can add as many reputations and personality traits as you wish. They can progress as abilities.\n\n## Base effects\n\nThe base effect is the root of any magical effect, spell or powers. They are intended to be used in the @UUID[JournalEntry.NGnaPcEcFR8xvhpR.JournalEntryPage.MOBLXlevcrM8tGiY]{Codex}.\n\n**Requisites**:\n\nYou can select additional arts as requisites by clicking on the hammer icon:\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/Requisites.webp)\n\nThe **base level** is the level of a spell with this effect with minimal attributes (Range: self, Duration: Momentary, Target : individual). It is the same number found in the book for the spell guidelines.\n\n## Magical effects\n\nA magical effect is like a spell and is designed like it.  \nThe concept doesn't exist in the official rules, but it is used in the system to keep a collection of commonly used spontaneous effects for a character. Instead of designing it every time in play, it is ready to use.\n\nSee **Spells** below for more details about the fields\n\n## Spells\n\n**Level:** The level field is read only. It is computed from the base level and all the other attributes as per the rules.\n\n**Spells attributes (Range, Duration, Target):** By default, the list of available attributes is limited to those of the core book. However, using the **sourcebook filter** setting, you can expand the list to those present in other books (note that most of them have restriction for their use). The number in parenthesis is the amount of magnitudes the spell level will increase.\n\n**Apply magical focus (owned):** This is to indicate if the spell effect falls into the scope of any magical focus the character possesses. Casting total will be computed accordingly.\n\n**Bonus and bonus description (owned):** These fields are here to cover any specific bonus not covered by the system (yet). Examples: specialities of abilities like Artes liberales for rituals, Talisman bonuses,…\n\n**Mastery (owned):** Like abilities, you can change the score by using the plus and minus signs or directly put the total experience.\n\n**Mastery abilities (owned)**: Just a free form text field for now, but expect it to change in the future…\n\n**General:** If checked, it will display the field named **Level Adjustment**\n\n**Level Adjustment:** this field allows to slightly adjust the level of a general spell so it is possible to have a value which is not a multiple of 5 (also useful for Aegis spell which doesn't follow the normal hermetic rules).\n\n**Target size:** Give information on what an Individual target is for each form.\n\n## Powers\n\n**Form**: used for magic resistance\n\n**Cost**: used to compute penetration based on the owner might score.\n\n## Enchantments\n\nEnchantments can be created from a magical effect or a spell using the @UUID[JournalEntry.NGnaPcEcFR8xvhpR.JournalEntryPage.MOBLXlevcrM8tGiY]{Codex}.  \nThere is an additional tab with new attributes specific to enchanting.\n\n  \n**Dev notes**: Enchanting as an activity is not fully implemented in the system (only lesser enchantments)\n\n## Diary entry\n\nThis item can be used as a standard diary for the character but also to create @UUID[JournalEntry.fCfU8W7PVHRKiFR1.JournalEntryPage.YVHrFeULB7NMF1HJ]{Long term activities} during down time between game sessions.\n\n**Dev notes**: the standard diary is still there for legacy reasons for people who used it as such in the past. I would recommend using a Foundry core JournalEntry for regular diaries as it is much easier to share between players or to do collaborative editing.\n\n## Books\n\n  \nTable of contents: Once you have finished defining all the topics of your book, you can generate the table of contents automatically by clicking the icon below the title (it will not erase anything in the description but append to it).\n\nThere two versions that can be generated:\n\n-   a concise one with just one click (1st one in the image below)\n    \n-   a verbose one by shift-click (2nd one in the image below)\n    \n    ![book1.webp]()\n    \n-   A book can have multiple topics of different types, you can browse them using the arrows, adding one more with the + icon, delete the current one with the Perdo hand gesture.\n    \n-   The last icon will open a @UUID[JournalEntry.FagPqMPacIz7p8Nd.JournalEntryPage.JvrGclcpMQ34AG64]{Scriptorium} with all the book fields preset. If the book is owned, it will also preset the reader.\n    \n    (For lab texts, the book needs to be in the inventory of the character or its sanctum\n    \n    ![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/book2.webp)\n    \n-   Topic: You can select whether the book is about an Art, an ability, a spell mastery or a laboratory text\n    \n\n-   See [[#Generic abilities]] for more explanations about the ability option field\n    \n\n## Physical items\n\nA physical item is something that exists in game as opposed to a virtue Item for example \n(books, weapons, armors, vis,...).\nWhen you drag and drop a physical item from an actor sheet to another, it will transfer it instead of creating a copy. If there more than one exemplar (ie: quantity field), it will ask how many should be moved. \nIt is possible to copy instead by pressing the SHIFT key (DevNote: due to a Foundry VTT limitation planned to be fixed in V12, you will have to press SHIFT after starting to drag the item)\n\n### Weapon\n\n**Ability:** The ability to apply when using the weapon.\n\n**Weapon expert:** Indicate the ability's specialty matches the weapon.\n\n### Enchanted items\n\nSome physical items are enchantable (items, weapons, armor,...), to access the enchantment attributes, click on the golden book in the sheet. Clicking again will destroy them, after confirmation.\n\n\n## Others\n\nThere are more types of Items but they don't have any particular feature yet beside pure data.","format":2,"content":"<p>The following Items are available for creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: You can create folder of Items in the sidebar or in a Compendium to be then dragged and dropped on an Actor (eg: Magus package, Grog package).

(see Ability key below).</p>\n<p><strong>Score</strong>: it can either be adjusted using the plus and minus signs or by directly inputting the experience amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Default characteristic:</strong> This selects the characteristic used by default when you roll that ability</p>\n<p><strong>Ability key:</strong> This is an <strong>important</strong> information for the system. It allows it to know which ability it is independently of its name. This permits the system to do a lot of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Check if a character has a specific ability and its score</p></li>\n<li><p>Automatically use an ability's score to implement some rules or compute some value (eg: Parma Magica, penetration).</p></li>\n<li><p>Know which ability to progress during a long term activity</p></li>\n<li><p>And more as the system evolves</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In short, if you don't configure it properly, some features won't work.</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>Ability option:</strong> This field is greyed out most of the time, except for generic abilities. See below</p>\n<p><strong>Active effects on abilities</strong></p>\n<p>Abilities modified by an active effect have a coloured halo</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/EffectsOnAbilities.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Puissant ability</p>\n<p>Affinity with ability</p>\n<p>Affinity with ability and puissant ability</p>\n<h3>Generic abilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Area lore, Organization lore, Languages (Dead or not), Craft, Profession, Mystery cult lore and supernatural power are generic abilities. They require an additional parameter to be recognized by the system, because there could be any number of them. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to differentiate them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Each generic ability with a different Ability option is totally independent of the others. It has its own speciality an default characteristic on rolls.</p></li>\n<li><p>Generic abilities in Compendia should already have their option set (eg: Dead language (Latin) has \"Latin\" in its ability option).</p></li>\n<li><p>The ability option is particularly useful when you want to add an affinity or puissant ability virtue. If you have multiple instance of an ability (eg: leatherwork and glassblowing, both craft abilities), using the option will allow to pick the correct one.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Important</strong>: only alphanumeric characters are allowed for an ability option. The system will automatically remove other characters. Use CamelCase if you want to put multiple words.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Virtues and Flaws</h2>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>: Some Actors will only accept virtues and flaws of a certain type.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong>: only used to keep track of how many points are used at character creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Usually empty (see FAQ), but in some cases there are active effects (see below) that need \"to be configured\". Look for that text before adding it.</p>\n<h3>Effects:</h3>\n<p>Virtues and flaws can have active effects which will be transmitted to their owner (see @UUID[JournalEntry.twIpCTIRKJMGbOVw.JournalEntryPage.mQBvNiLPBZjOao0F]{Active effects}). Whenever possible, those are already configured in the system Compendia (eg: the Large virtue will give +1 size).</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before V11, due to a Foundry core's limitation, it is not possible to edit active effects of an owned Item. You must edit it first in the sidebar. It is particularly relevant for effects that need configuration like Affinity, Puissant art, etc.</p>\n<h3>Personality traits and reputations</h3>\n<p>You can add as many reputations and personality traits as you wish. They can progress as abilities.</p>\n<h2>Base effects</h2>\n<p>The base effect is the root of any magical effect, spell or powers. They are intended to be used in the @UUID[JournalEntry.NGnaPcEcFR8xvhpR.JournalEntryPage.MOBLXlevcrM8tGiY]{Codex}.</p>\n<p><strong>Requisites</strong>:</p>\n<p>You can select additional arts as requisites by clicking on the hammer icon:</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/Requisites.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>base level</strong> is the level of a spell with this effect with minimal attributes (Range: self, Duration: Momentary, Target : individual). It is the same number found in the book for the spell guidelines.</p>\n<h2>Magical effects</h2>\n<p>A magical effect is like a spell and is designed like it.<br />\nThe concept doesn't exist in the official rules, but it is used in the system to keep a collection of commonly used spontaneous effects for a character. Instead of designing it every time in play, it is ready to use.</p>\n<p>See <strong>Spells</strong> below for more details about the fields</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p><strong>Level:</strong> The level field is read only. It is computed from the base level and all the other attributes as per the rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells attributes (Range, Duration, Target):</strong> By default, the list of available attributes is limited to those of the core book. However, using the <strong>sourcebook filter</strong> setting, you can expand the list to those present in other books (note that most of them have restriction for their use). The number in parenthesis is the amount of magnitudes the spell level will increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Apply magical focus (owned):</strong> This is to indicate if the spell effect falls into the scope of any magical focus the character possesses. Casting total will be computed accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus and bonus description (owned):</strong> These fields are here to cover any specific bonus not covered by the system (yet). Examples: specialities of abilities like Artes liberales for rituals, Talisman bonuses,…</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery (owned):</strong> Like abilities, you can change the score by using the plus and minus signs or directly put the total experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery abilities (owned)</strong>: Just a free form text field for now, but expect it to change in the future…</p>\n<p><strong>General:</strong> If checked, it will display the field named <strong>Level Adjustment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level Adjustment:</strong> this field allows to slightly adjust the level of a general spell so it is possible to have a value which is not a multiple of 5 (also useful for Aegis spell which doesn't follow the normal hermetic rules).</p>\n<p><strong>Target size:</strong> Give information on what an Individual target is for each form.</p>\n<h2>Powers</h2>\n<p><strong>Form</strong>: used for magic resistance</p>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong>: used to compute penetration based on the owner might score.</p>\n<h2>Enchantments</h2>\n<p>Enchantments can be created from a magical effect or a spell using the @UUID[JournalEntry.NGnaPcEcFR8xvhpR.JournalEntryPage.MOBLXlevcrM8tGiY]{Codex}.<br />\nThere is an additional tab with new attributes specific to enchanting.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev notes</strong>: Enchanting as an activity is not fully implemented in the system (only lesser enchantments)</p>\n<h2>Diary entry</h2>\n<p>This item can be used as a standard diary for the character but also to create @UUID[JournalEntry.fCfU8W7PVHRKiFR1.JournalEntryPage.YVHrFeULB7NMF1HJ]{Long term activities} during down time between game sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev notes</strong>: the standard diary is still there for legacy reasons for people who used it as such in the past. I would recommend using a Foundry core JournalEntry for regular diaries as it is much easier to share between players or to do collaborative editing.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>Table of contents: Once you have finished defining all the topics of your book, you can generate the table of contents automatically by clicking the icon below the title (it will not erase anything in the description but append to it).</p>\n<p>There two versions that can be generated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>a concise one with just one click (1st one in the image below)</p></li>\n<li><p>a verbose one by shift-click (2nd one in the image below)</p>\n<p>![book1.webp]()</p></li>\n<li><p>A book can have multiple topics of different types, you can browse them using the arrows, adding one more with the + icon, delete the current one with the Perdo hand gesture.</p></li>\n<li><p>The last icon will open a @UUID[JournalEntry.FagPqMPacIz7p8Nd.JournalEntryPage.JvrGclcpMQ34AG64]{Scriptorium} with all the book fields preset. If the book is owned, it will also preset the reader.</p>\n<p>(For lab texts, the book needs to be in the inventory of the character or its sanctum</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/book2.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p>Topic: You can select whether the book is about an Art, an ability, a spell mastery or a laboratory text</p></li>\n<li><p>See [[#Generic abilities]] for more explanations about the ability option field</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical items</h2>\n<p>A physical item is something that exists in game as opposed to a virtue Item for example \n(books, weapons, armors, vis,…).\nWhen you drag and drop a physical item from an actor sheet to another, it will transfer it instead of creating a copy. If there more than one exemplar (ie: quantity field), it will ask how many should be moved. \nIt is possible to copy instead by pressing the SHIFT key (DevNote: due to a Foundry VTT limitation planned to be fixed in V12, you will have to press SHIFT after starting to drag the item)</p>\n<h3>Weapon</h3>\n<p><strong>Ability:</strong> The ability to apply when using the weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon expert:</strong> Indicate the ability's specialty matches the weapon.</p>\n<h3>Enchanted items</h3>\n<p>Some physical items are enchantable (items, weapons, armor,…), to access the enchantment attributes, click on the golden book in the sheet. Clicking again will destroy them, after confirmation.</p>\n<h2>Others</h2>\n<p>There are more types of Items but they don't have any particular feature yet beside pure data.</p>"},"_id":"EKW28yHd4a54NLnp","type":"text","system":{},"title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.MarkdownJournalPageSheet"}},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.1.8","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"exportSource":null},"category":null}],"sort":0,"flags":{"world":{"lavaFlowJournalEntry":true}},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.1.8","createdTime":1766959588690,"modifiedTime":1766959588690,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J","exportSource":null},"categories":[]}

If you don't have the shield equipped, the specialty bonus doesn't apply.\n\n- Create a 'mounted' item with the ability to 'mount' and mark on its attributes that it is a horse. When you equip it, the calculations will be applied.\n\n### Other rolls\n\nMost rolls are triggered by clicking on the appropriate label.\n\n## Magic\n\nOnce you cast a spell, do spontaneous magic or use a power, the result of the roll will appear in chat:\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/SpellChatResult.webp)\n\n- Icon of the token. Clicking on it will open its sheet.\n\n- The name of the spell/magical effect and its level\n\n- Icon of the spell if applicable.\n\n- Details of the roll modifiers including penetration computation\n\n- Roll formula\n\n- Casting total without penetration\n\n- Penetration total in parentheses\n\n- The small icon is to use a confidence point if available.\n\nIf the spell is cast while one or more tokens are selected, additional message per target will appear in the chat indicating whether the spell successfully overcame magic resistance:\n\n![](modules/arm5e-compendia/doc/images/MagicContest.webp)\n\nNote that with the right @UUID[JournalEntry.AYlByKlrOc3BuHOG.JournalEntryPage.WwcmJz7FCM5GKVJq]{Settings}, a player will only see whether if the spell was a success or not, the details are reserved for the GM.\n\n## Combat\n\n**Dev note**: Combat being usually short and deadly in Ars Magica, it hasn't been properly integrated in the Foundry framework yet. At the moment, you can roll for initiative with it to have an action order, but it is a simplified version of the rules (ie: no reroll is made in case of tie).\n\n- On **Attack** or **Defense** rolls, it is possible to exert self (ie: lose a fatigue level) to double the ability score.\n\n- **Damage** roll will automatically compute the advantage based on the previous attack and defence chat messages. That's why the GM should pay attention that players only roll when it is their turn, otherwise the Advantage must be computed \"manually\".\n\n- **Soak** roll will retrieve the result of the latest **Damage** roll to be applied to the target or zero if none are found.\n\n  - Size is taken into account for the computation of wounds\n\n  - This is also the way to apply damage from external events (fire, fall, etc)\n\n  - Select your Form resistance bonus if you are a Magus (eg: Ignem for fire damage) or if you have an active effect which applies\n\n  - Natural resistance: Some virtues and flaws may give modifiers to soak rolls (eg: Fire resistance or vulnerability) through Active effects. You can select it here.\n\n  - **Dev note:** Spell damage will be applied differently in the future.\n\n Click on the Soak label to apply a given amount of damage. If a combat is ongoing, it will automatically compute the correct amount to soak. Size, stamina, armor, etc are automatically taken in account to compute the correct wound type.\n## Macro dialogs\n\nIt is sometimes cumbersome to change stats or roll a specific test in the heat of the action (even more as a GM who has to manage a bunch of NPCs). If the hotbar can help for abilities or spells, it is not possible for some others. That's why the following macros were created.\n\nTo use them, select a token on the scene and execute them.\n\n- **Quick combat** Attack, defense, damage, soak, all the combat rolls are accessible in a small dialog\n- **Quick vitals** Manage fatigue and wounds as well as resting\n- **Quick magic** Quick access to spellcasting stances (voice and gestures), spontaneous magic and standard rolls like fastcasting speed and targeting.","format":2,"content":"<h2>Rolls</h2>\n<p>You can trigger a roll by clicking on the relevant item you want to roll or, occasionally, on the die icon next to the item.

Imaginem canot affect light, as this is part of Ignem, but it can affect the things that light allows you to see.<br />Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour, all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Imaginem. An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human. Similarly, everyone can sense an illusion created by Imaginem magic. Nevertheless, Imaginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends. Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead. Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn. Certain members of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion, though the talent is not dependable.<br />It is more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Imaginem spell than it is to mimic a general image, and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll: the higher roll, the better you can fool people. You get a a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (-3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar object or for having the subject available for modeling). For mimicking people, a roll of 6+ lets you fool acquietances of the person, 9+ lets you fool friends, and 12+ lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar scale for mimicking objects. If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use. A base Individual for Imaginem is the equivalent of an adult human being; whether a visual image of about that size, an auditory illusion making that much noise, or whatever.</p><hr /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>CREO</strong></p><p>It is importatant to note that Creo Imaginem only creates the images of things, not the things themselves. This is the first (and most important) clue that image is just an illusion. On the other hand, the illusion of a wall may feel solid, but will present no resistance if someone pushes a hand through it.<br />Increasing the complexity of a sensory perception, such as making a moving visual image or making clear words instead of noise, adds an additional level of magnitude. Making an image or noise at your direction as you concentrate adds two level of magnitude. In addition, very intricate images (an intricately ornated bridge) are generally one level of magnitude higher as well.<br />Creo Imaginem botches may create the wrong illusion, or obvious ones clearly linked back to the caster.</p><p></p><p><strong>Level 1:</strong> Create an image that affects a single sense.</p><p><strong>Level 2:</strong> Create an image that affects two senses.</p><p><strong>Level 3:</strong> Create an image that affects three senses.</p><p><strong>Level 4:</strong> Create an image that affects four senses.</p><p><strong>Level 5:</strong> Create an image that affects five senses.</p><hr /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>INTELLEGO</strong></p><p>These spells improve upon your senses by bringing in images, usually sounds and images, not normally available.

Magic items cannot be investigated with simple spells, but require a season spent in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains and how to use them (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell can only tell you that an item is magical, and and perhaps give some hint of its powers, but never how to use it.<br />Further increases in level will give increased sensivity to residues. The base level of a spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of a spell (within a magnitude). The addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. Furthere increases in the level will yeld further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.<br />Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell affects only one realm, and Storyguides may disallow spells that detect the Divine or Infernal.<br />As a general rule, the residues of magic decline as follows: as soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves, it then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Storyguides should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with “negative magnitude”.<br />Magical items can have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices). Magnitudes for non-Hermetic items must be setted by the Storyguide. A spell that detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.<br />Magical creatures can also be detected: treat their Might as the level of the effect; for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might (or the Art) by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again this requires a different spells and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures (not Demons). Storyguides may allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.<br />Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrilevant as is the the realm of power that it was designed to detect. However, only specially designed spells will yeld any information other than that it is raw vis.<br />Intellego Vim botches generally provide false information.</p><p></p><p><strong>Level 1:</strong> Detect magic of 10° magnitude or higher</p><ul><li><p>Detect the presence of a mystical aura.</p></li><li><p>Detect the presence of raw vis.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Level 2:</strong> Detect magic of 8° magnitude or higher.</p><ul><li><p>Determine the power of a mystical aura.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Level 3:</strong> Detect magic of 6° magnitude or higher.</p><ul><li><p>Detect regio boundaries.

It is not normally possible to have a MuVi spell that lasts longer than the target spell.<br />These meta-magical spells have certain restrictions, which apply to all MuVi spells invented according to Hermetic theory. First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells: such magic is being manipulated at whim – any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control.<br />Second, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells: if this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch.<br />If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus you must either be cooperating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition your Penetration total for the MuVi spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are cooperating.<br />Touch range is sufficient to affect your own spells, but Voice range at least, is needed to affect another magus's casting. You cannot touch the spell itself.<br />These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the process involved. You may only put a MuVi effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All MuVi spells require some tailoring to the specific use, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.<br />Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way; it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants. See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be.<br />It is not possible to use MuVi to affect another spell after it has been cast.<br />A Muto Vim botch will generally affect the target spell in an undesirable way.</p><p></p><p><strong>General:</strong> Superficially change a spell of less than twice the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell. This may not change the primary effect of the spell or its power.</p><ul><li><p>Significantly change a spell of less than the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell. This may not change either the Tecnique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.</p></li><li><p>Totally change a spell of less than half the (level +1 magnitude) of the MuVi spell.This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts.

Any grater change requires either Creo or Perdo to create more magical energy or destroy some.</p></li></ul><hr /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>PERDO</strong></p><p>If you want to cast a PeVi spell on a character who has Magic Resistance, you must overcome the Magic Resistance.<br />Perdo Vim botches may dispel the wrong spells or effects, damage an aura, deplete vis or harm resistances or might scores.</p><p></p><p><strong>General:</strong> Make something, including a magical item, seem non-magical to any Intellego spell of less than twice the (level –2 magnitudes) of this spell.</p><ul><li><p>Dispel effects of a specific type with a level less than the (level +4 magnitudes) of the Vim spell + stress die(no botch).

Siempre que sea posible, estos ya estarán configurados en el compendio de sistema (por ejemplo, la Virtud Grande ya aumenta el Tamaño en +1).</p><p><strong>Importante: </strong>Debido a una limitación de Foundry básico, no es posible editar efectos activos en un objeto que ya es propiedad de un Actor. Hay que editarlo antes en el menú lateral. Esto es especialmente relevante para efectos que requieren configuración como Afinidad, Maña, etc.</p><p></p><h2>Efecto base</h2><p>El efecto base es el cimiento de cualquier efecto, hechizo o poder mágico.

Tiene el mismo número que se puede encontrar en las guías de nivel que aparecen en el manual.</p><h2>Efectos mágicos</h2><p>Un efecto mágico es como un hechizo y se diseña igual. <br />El concepto no existe en las reglas oficiales, pero el sistema lo usa para mantener una lista de los efectos espontáneos más comunes para un personaje. En lugar de diseñarlo cada vez en juego, aquí está listo para su uso.</p><p>Ver <strong>Hechizos</strong>, a continuación, para más detalles sobre los campos.</p><h2>Hechizos</h2><p><strong>Nivel: </strong>El campo de nivel es solo lectura. Se calcula a partir del nivel base y todo el resto de atributos indicados en las reglas.</p><p><strong>Parámetros de hechizos (Alcance, Duración, Objetivo): </strong>Por defecto, la lista de parámetros disponibles está limitada a los que aparecen en el manual básico. Sin embargo, usando el <strong>filtro por suplemento</strong> se puede expandir la lista para que incluya los que aparecen en otros libros (nótese que la mayoría tienen restricciones para su uso). El número entre paréntsis indica la cantidad de magnitudes que aumentará el nivel de base.</p><p><strong>Aplicar focus mágico (propietario): </strong>Esta casilla indica que el efecto de hechizo entra dentro del alcance de cualquier focus mágico que pueda poseer el personaje. El total de lanzamiento se calculará de manera acorde.</p><p><strong>Bonificación y descripción de la bonificación (propietario): </strong>Estos campos se incluyen para cubrir cualquier bonificación específica que no esté cubierta (aún) por el sistema. Ejemplos: especializaciones de habilidades como Artes Liberales para rituales, bonificacoines por talismanes, etc.</p><p><strong>Dominio (propietario): </strong>Al igual que las habilidades, puedes cambiar la puntuación usando el + o el - o introduciendo directamente la experiencia total.</p><p><strong>Habilidades de dominio (propietario): </strong>Ahora mismo es un campo de texto normal, pero en el futuro probablemente cambiará…</p><p><strong>General: </strong>Si se marca, mostrará el campo llamado <strong>Ajuste de nivel.</strong></p><p><strong>Ajuste de nivel: </strong>Este campo permite ajustar ligeramente el nivel de un hechizo general de manera que sea posible tener un valor que no sea múltiplo de cinco.</p><p><strong>Tamaño del objetivo: </strong>Proporciona información sobre el tamaño de un objetivo Individual para cada Forma.</p><p></p><h2>Poderes</h2><p><strong>Forma</strong>: Se usa para la resistencia mágica.</p><p><strong>Coste</strong>: Se usa para calcular la penetración en función de la puntuación de Poder del propietario.</p><h2>Encantamientos</h2><p>Se pueden crear encantamientos a partir de un efecto mágico o un hechizo usando el @UUID[.X4B31bvwKOCJefPn#codex-hermeticum-(violeta)]{Codex Hermeticum (violeta)}.<br />Hay una pestaña adicional con nuevos atributos específicos de esta actividad.</p><p><br /><strong>Nota del desarrollador</strong>: El encantamiento de objetos como actividad aún no está implementado en el sistema, pero la hoja se puede usar para diseñarlos, puesto que el nivel se computa igualmente de manera automática.</p><h2>Entrada de diario</h2><p>Este Objeto puede usarse como una entrada de diario normal para el personaje, pero también para crear @UUID[.x3UWNVGwHqQSh3sF]{Actividades estacionales} durante el tiempo entre sesión y sesión de juego.</p><p><strong>Nota del desarrollador: </strong>La entrada de diario normal sigue existiendo en consideración a la gente que la usó como era en el pasado.

Si querías usar el libro como plantilla, puedes desvincularlo haciendo clic en el icono del clip y volver a editarlo. </p></li><li><p>Puedes resetear el lector haciendo clic en el icono del clip. </p></li><li><p>Una forma más rápida y conveniente de abrir el Scriptorium es desde la propia hoja del libro, haciendo clic en el icono del ojo. El libro será elegido automáticamente y si es propiedad de un personaje, este será asignado como lector por defecto. </p></li><li><p>Se hacen una serie de comprobaciones antes para comprobar que el personaje es capaz de leer el libro:</p><ul><li><p>El \"lector\" debe saber leer (debe tener Artes Liberales a 1+)</p></li><li><p>Debe conocer un idioma a nivel 4. (Es demasiado complejo/imposible para el sistema comprobar si es el lenguaje adecuado. Sujeto a la aprobación del DJ).</p></li><li><p>El Nivel del libro (en caso de una summa) debe ser superior a la habilidad del lector en el tema en cuestión.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>La ganancia por Calidad estará limitada por el nivel del libro. Aparecerá un aviso indicando que cualquier experiencia sobrante será ignorada.</p></li></ul><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/Scriptorium2.png\" /><ul><li><p>Para dominios de hechizos y habilidades genéricas, es complicado lograr que coincida exactamente con el nombre del hechizo (incluidas traducciones) o la opción de habilidad. Se ofrece la opción de elegir el atributo correcto bajo la aprobación del DJ.</p></li><li><p>Una vez todo está debidamente configurado, se activará el botón \"Crear actividad\" y se podrá crear una nueva entrada de diario, que a su vez puede ser aplicada (y anulada si fuese necesario).

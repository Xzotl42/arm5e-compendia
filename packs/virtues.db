These effects are beneficial to her for the most part, and are perhaps a reward or an enticement for her service to Hell. If this is a Minor Virtue, you receive 60 levels of unholy effects, designed as if they were cast on the character with Touch Range, probably with Forsaken Duration (Chapter 10: The Maleficia; New Ranges, Durations, and Targets), with the limit that no single effect can exceed level 40. If this is a Major Virtue, you receive 120 levels of effects, and the maximum level of an effect is level 60. These effects should correspond to the Methods and Powers available to the character’s Infernal tradition (see Chapter 13), or seem appropriate to a demon with which the character is familiar. If these blessings do come directly from a demon, you should still determine the level of the effect in the same way as if they were maleficia. You may take this Virtue more than once, and the total number of levels may be added together, so that two Minor are still limited to level 40 effects. Because this is a Tainted Virtue, you cannot take it more than five times (or ten times, if the character is a Mythic Companion). Here are some common blessings. All, of course, are subject to storyguide approval, and should be examined to determine if they would imbalance your saga.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Ability </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Phantasm, Level 20): The character’s body is changed to give her an unnatural ability (such as wings, an additional limb, retracting fangs, or eyes that can see in the dark), though this does not function in the Dominion or when she is subjected to an uncommon circumstance such as salt, running water, or iron.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Confidence </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Psychomachia, Level 20): The character gains an additional Confidence Point.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Device </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Effusion, Level 40): The character has a device enchanted to produce an unholy effect of up to level 15.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Greatness </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 60): The character receives the effects of an appropriate Major Virtue, such as Greater Immunity, Ways of the (Land), or Wealthy.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Health </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Consumption, Level 40): The character gains a +3 bonus to all Aging rolls at the expense of another, who receives a –3 penalty. If this victim dies, her blessing ceases to be effective.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Powers </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 40): The character receives the effects of an appropriate Minor Virtue, such as Affinity with (Ability), Increased Characteristics, Puissant (Ability), or Self-Confident.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Protection </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 40): The character has a Magic Resistance score of 15.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Prowess </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Consumption, Level 40): The character has enhanced the effectiveness of her body, giving her a +3 bonus to either Soak or Damage, but adding 3 to her Load; or increasing her Initiative, Attack, or Defense by 3, but penalizing her Fatigue rolls by the same amount.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Taking this Virtue also gives the character 3 Warping Points and an experience point in a relevant Infernal Reputation. It is marginally possible for the character to have blessings that she is not aware are Infernal, since people in Mythic Europe do not know how many points of Virtues and Flaws they have, and thus she may think that she has been rewarded by a benevolent power. However, this requires that she has not accepted absolution from the Divine since she gained these Powers, and she must have some sort of Infernal background that explains why she has been kept in the dark about this. When she realizes the truth, she must decide whether she wishes to continue as an infernalist, or repent and lose her Powers forever</span>.</p>","source":"custom","page":85,"indexKey":"infernal-blessing-major","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","credits":"","type":"supernatural","impact":{"value":"major"},"hidden":false,"tainted":true},"effects":[],"folder":"zbXsj4TBQ7fnb7ME","flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0.16","createdTime":1757740088763,"modifiedTime":1757740088763,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J","exportSource":null},"_id":"80oeA0rf2m9HWZTd","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Without a Might score, the pool does not replenish; once the character has spent all of his Might points this power ends. All powers used have their duration lapse when the character uses his last point of Might Pool. If this power is evoked again while the character still possesses Might Pool, then the new points gained replace the points left over; the two pools do not add.

In addition, she receives a minor physical advantage appropriate to one of the four different types of magic beings (magic animals, magic humans, magic spirits, and magic things), the one that is associated with the character’s background. Some examples are below, or you can make up your own.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Magic Animal: </strong></p><p>The character has a physical feature normally associated with animals, such as wings, scales, gills, teeth, or claws. These give as much as a +3 bonus to appropriate activities, or may allow the character to perform actions that a normal character could not manage (such as fly, or breathe underwater). This feature is very difficult to hide, making the character obviously different from other humans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Magic Human: </strong>The character may increase one of his Characteristics by 1, but not above +3. This is often Strength or Stamina (to represent the blood of giant ancestors), or Presence (to represent the blood of god-like beings). This often gives the character an otherworldly appearance. The character also has a positive Reputation at level 3 among others of his bloodline.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Magic Spirit: </strong>The character gains an appropriate Supernatural Ability (one associated with a Minor Virtue), such as Magic Sensitivity, Premonitions, Second Sight, or Wilderness Sense, with an initial score of 1, though whenever the character uses this Ability, her appearance becomes obviously supernatural.

This Virtue can only be bought if the character also has the Leprosy Flaw, and is only available to magi trained in House Tytalus. It allows him to draw upon the strength of his body to increase the power of his magic, granting the Life Boost Minor Virtue. He can also draw even deeper into this power if he desires, mortifying his disease-ridden flesh to produce vis to power his own spells. The vis generated in this way can only be used by the magus himself, in spellcasting or laboratory activities (but not study), and cannot be stored in any way — in fact, it never leaves his body. By accepting a Light Wound, the magus can infuse a single magical working with three pawns of vis, of any Technique or Form. A Medium Wound supplies six pawns, a Heavy Wound nine pawns, an Incapacitating Wound 12 pawns, and a Deadly Wound (killing the magus) 15 pawns. Any vis that is produced beyond the magus’s capacity to use in the current magical activity is lost, as is any vis surplus to the requirements of the activity to which this power is applied. Leprotic wounds open on the magus’s body as he calls upon this power, but not quickly enough to affect the Casting Total of a non-Ritual spell affected by this power. All Lab Totals suffer the wound penalty as normal, as do the Casting Totals of spells that take more than one round to cast (such as Ritual spells). The character makes no Recovery rolls for this wound until the magical activity that the vis is being used for is complete (i.e., at the end of the casting of the spell, or the end of a season for lab work).

{"name":"Infernal Blessing - Minor","type":"virtue","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/VF/supernatural.svg","system":{"description":"<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Because of the character’s association with demons or an Infernal tradition (see Chapter 13: Infernal Traditions), she has been affected by a demon’s Infernal Powers or targeted by one or more unholy maleficia (see Chapter 10). These effects are beneficial to her for the most part, and are perhaps a reward or an enticement for her service to Hell. If this is a Minor Virtue, you receive 60 levels of unholy effects, designed as if they were cast on the character with Touch Range, probably with Forsaken Duration (Chapter 10: The Maleficia; New Ranges, Durations, and Targets), with the limit that no single effect can exceed level 40. If this is a Major Virtue, you receive 120 levels of effects, and the maximum level of an effect is level 60. These effects should correspond to the Methods and Powers available to the character’s Infernal tradition (see Chapter 13), or seem appropriate to a demon with which the character is familiar. If these blessings do come directly from a demon, you should still determine the level of the effect in the same way as if they were maleficia. You may take this Virtue more than once, and the total number of levels may be added together, so that two Minor are still limited to level 40 effects. Because this is a Tainted Virtue, you cannot take it more than five times (or ten times, if the character is a Mythic Companion). Here are some common blessings. All, of course, are subject to storyguide approval, and should be examined to determine if they would imbalance your saga.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Ability </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Phantasm, Level 20): The character’s body is changed to give her an unnatural ability (such as wings, an additional limb, retracting fangs, or eyes that can see in the dark), though this does not function in the Dominion or when she is subjected to an uncommon circumstance such as salt, running water, or iron.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Confidence </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Psychomachia, Level 20): The character gains an additional Confidence Point.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Device </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Effusion, Level 40): The character has a device enchanted to produce an unholy effect of up to level 15.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Greatness </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 60): The character receives the effects of an appropriate Major Virtue, such as Greater Immunity, Ways of the (Land), or Wealthy.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Health </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Consumption, Level 40): The character gains a +3 bonus to all Aging rolls at the expense of another, who receives a –3 penalty. If this victim dies, her blessing ceases to be effective.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Powers </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 40): The character receives the effects of an appropriate Minor Virtue, such as Affinity with (Ability), Increased Characteristics, Puissant (Ability), or Self-Confident.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Protection </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Incantation, Diablerie, Level 40): The character has a Magic Resistance score of 15.<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">• Infernal Prowess </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Debauchery, Consumption, Level 40): The character has enhanced the effectiveness of her body, giving her a +3 bonus to either Soak or Damage, but adding 3 to her Load; or increasing her Initiative, Attack, or Defense by 3, but penalizing her Fatigue rolls by the same amount.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Taking this Virtue also gives the character 3 Warping Points and an experience point in a relevant Infernal Reputation. It is marginally possible for the character to have blessings that she is not aware are Infernal, since people in Mythic Europe do not know how many points of Virtues and Flaws they have, and thus she may think that she has been rewarded by a benevolent power. However, this requires that she has not accepted absolution from the Divine since she gained these Powers, and she must have some sort of Infernal background that explains why she has been kept in the dark about this. When she realizes the truth, she must decide whether she wishes to continue as an infernalist, or repent and lose her Powers forever</span>.</p>","source":"custom","page":85,"indexKey":"infernal-blessing-minor","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","credits":"","type":"supernatural","impact":{"value":"minor"},"hidden":false,"tainted":true},"effects":[],"folder":"zbXsj4TBQ7fnb7ME","flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0.16","createdTime":1757740088763,"modifiedTime":1757740088763,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J","exportSource":null},"_id":"Sc7y2QLfedCtPbl5","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Her effective age (which applies as if it were her real age when creating a Longevity Ritual and when making rolls on the Aging Table) increases two years for every year that passes, and you must make two aging rolls each year once her effective age reaches 35. There is no way to halt or slow this other than Longevity Rituals, if she can convince someone to make one for her. However, she does not show the effects of aging; any Aging Points acquired do not get applied to her Characteristics, although they do still count as experience points towards Decrepitude. </p><p> </p><p>You cannot take the Infernal Blessings Virtue described in <em>Realms of Power: The Infernal</em>; the Demonic Powers Virtue replaces that Virtue for the demon-blooded.

The benefits of Potent Magic are compatible with a Magical Focus; unlike a Magical Focus, a maga may have more than one area of Potent Magic, although only one Potent Magic Virtue applies to any single activity. </p><p> Potent Magic provides the maga with a bonus in her field of magic, and permits her to devise Potent spells that gain a casting bonus from the sympathetic magic in shapes and materials. Potent Magic can be taught as an alternative to a Magical Focus. </p><p> Minor Potent Magic covers the same narrow fields as a Minor Magical Focus, and grants a +3 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> Major Potent Magic covers the same wide fields as a Major Magical Focus, and grants a +6 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> A maga with Potent Magic may also invent new Potent spells within the field of her Potent Magic, and may vary spells she knows.</p><p> <strong>Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A Potent spell has a bonus known as its Potency, which is arrived at by combining one or more Casting Items into the design of the spell. Casting Items use the factors given in the Shape and Material Bonus table (page @@): each Casting Item provides one bonus. (If more than one bonus is possible, the spell design states which one is used.) </p><p> <strong>Potency Score = Sum of Bonus from each Casting Item </strong></p><p> <strong>Potency Bonus: Add Potency to Casting Score </strong></p><p> Potency is part of the spell design; a Lab Text for a Potent spell includes the specified Casting Items and Potency Score. A magus teaching a Potent spell teaches the formula he knows, including the Casting Items and Potency Score. The level, for the purposes of inventing it as well as for casting, of a Potent spell is unaltered by the Potency Score. However, a magus may not invent a Potent spell with a Potency higher than his Magic Theory score, even with the aid of a Lab Text or teacher. </p><p> Any magus can learn a Potent spell from a Lab Text or teacher, and apply Potency to his Casting Score; the Potent Magic Virtue is required to design a Potent spell from scratch, but not to reproduce one from a Lab Text. </p><p> To cast a Potent spell, the caster must touch the specified Casting Items. The items need not be large; they may be small and symbolic (for example, a shield-shaped brooch is still symbolically a shield). If the caster does not have the Casting Items available, the spell cannot be cast at all. </p><p> <em>Example: A wand provides several bonuses including +2 “repel things” and +4 “control things at a distance.” A Potent version of Disguise of the Putrid Aroma could use either bonus in its Potency. Combining it with magnetite (+3 Animal) allows a design with either Potency 5 (requires Magic Theory 5) or Potency 7 (requires Magic Theory 7). The caster must hold a wand and piece of magnetite (or a wand set with magnetite) to add the Potency to his Casting Score. </em></p><p> Potency applies only to Formulaic spells — Spontaneous Magic allows Ceremonial Casting to produce similar results, and enchanted devices use Shape and Material Bonuses during enchantment. </p><p> <strong>Potent Magic And Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A magus with Potent Magic may create new Potent spells or alter Potent spells to vary the Casting Items. </p><p> When inventing a spell within the field of his Potent Magic (including from a Lab Text), the magus simply chooses Casting Items for the design, and then invents the spell as normal. Each chosen Casting Item (up to the limit of Magic Theory) adds a single Shape or Material Bonus to Potency; if more than one bonus might apply to the spell, choose one and note it in the design. The total Potency may not exceed the magus’s Magic Theory. </p><p> A Lab Text written for this spell includes the Casting Items and Potency, and is usable by any other magus. </p><p> In addition, a magus who knows a spell within the field of his Potent Magic may invent a variant spell with different Casting Items (including a variant with no Casting Items). If the only difference is a change in Casting Items, he may invent the variant as if in possession of a Lab Text. If, for any reason, his current Lab Total is lower than the level of the spell, he may still invent the variant in a single season.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"minor"},"indexKey":"potent-magic-minor","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1729674679675,"modifiedTime":1731255711149,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM","exportSource":null},"folder":"C8jqPqfblXk6hGCE","_id":"czW3ywbkvrK8X9TX","sort":3100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

For example, a river, or canal, or lake, or sea is a water-way.

The benefits of Potent Magic are compatible with a Magical Focus; unlike a Magical Focus, a maga may have more than one area of Potent Magic, although only one Potent Magic Virtue applies to any single activity. </p><p> Potent Magic provides the maga with a bonus in her field of magic, and permits her to devise Potent spells that gain a casting bonus from the sympathetic magic in shapes and materials. Potent Magic can be taught as an alternative to a Magical Focus. </p><p> Minor Potent Magic covers the same narrow fields as a Minor Magical Focus, and grants a +3 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> Major Potent Magic covers the same wide fields as a Major Magical Focus, and grants a +6 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> A maga with Potent Magic may also invent new Potent spells within the field of her Potent Magic, and may vary spells she knows.</p><p> <strong>Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A Potent spell has a bonus known as its Potency, which is arrived at by combining one or more Casting Items into the design of the spell. Casting Items use the factors given in the Shape and Material Bonus table (page @@): each Casting Item provides one bonus. (If more than one bonus is possible, the spell design states which one is used.) </p><p> <strong>Potency Score = Sum of Bonus from each Casting Item </strong></p><p> <strong>Potency Bonus: Add Potency to Casting Score </strong></p><p> Potency is part of the spell design; a Lab Text for a Potent spell includes the specified Casting Items and Potency Score. A magus teaching a Potent spell teaches the formula he knows, including the Casting Items and Potency Score. The level, for the purposes of inventing it as well as for casting, of a Potent spell is unaltered by the Potency Score. However, a magus may not invent a Potent spell with a Potency higher than his Magic Theory score, even with the aid of a Lab Text or teacher. </p><p> Any magus can learn a Potent spell from a Lab Text or teacher, and apply Potency to his Casting Score; the Potent Magic Virtue is required to design a Potent spell from scratch, but not to reproduce one from a Lab Text. </p><p> To cast a Potent spell, the caster must touch the specified Casting Items. The items need not be large; they may be small and symbolic (for example, a shield-shaped brooch is still symbolically a shield). If the caster does not have the Casting Items available, the spell cannot be cast at all. </p><p> <em>Example: A wand provides several bonuses including +2 “repel things” and +4 “control things at a distance.” A Potent version of Disguise of the Putrid Aroma could use either bonus in its Potency. Combining it with magnetite (+3 Animal) allows a design with either Potency 5 (requires Magic Theory 5) or Potency 7 (requires Magic Theory 7). The caster must hold a wand and piece of magnetite (or a wand set with magnetite) to add the Potency to his Casting Score. </em></p><p> Potency applies only to Formulaic spells — Spontaneous Magic allows Ceremonial Casting to produce similar results, and enchanted devices use Shape and Material Bonuses during enchantment. </p><p> <strong>Potent Magic And Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A magus with Potent Magic may create new Potent spells or alter Potent spells to vary the Casting Items. </p><p> When inventing a spell within the field of his Potent Magic (including from a Lab Text), the magus simply chooses Casting Items for the design, and then invents the spell as normal. Each chosen Casting Item (up to the limit of Magic Theory) adds a single Shape or Material Bonus to Potency; if more than one bonus might apply to the spell, choose one and note it in the design. The total Potency may not exceed the magus’s Magic Theory. </p><p> A Lab Text written for this spell includes the Casting Items and Potency, and is usable by any other magus. </p><p> In addition, a magus who knows a spell within the field of his Potent Magic may invent a variant spell with different Casting Items (including a variant with no Casting Items). If the only difference is a change in Casting Items, he may invent the variant as if in possession of a Lab Text. If, for any reason, his current Lab Total is lower than the level of the spell, he may still invent the variant in a single season.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"major"},"indexKey":"potent-magic-major","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1729674705556,"modifiedTime":1731255711154,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM","exportSource":null},"folder":"ryEkrZYbf9tQGIrO","_id":"iIIsjkAOCdkrABVO","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Warriors with a </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">have the ability to enter a trance within sight of the battlefield, so that they can send forth their spirit to do battle in animal shape. An example is the folk hero Boðvar Bjarki, who would hide before battles but was not considered a coward by his fellows because a great white bear would appear in his stead, and he would have the bear’s injuries after the battle.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If the warrior’s body is found while he is in a trance, he is in a very vulnerable state. His body will not awaken until the </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">returns to it. If the body is killed, the </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">becomes an unusual ghost, and there are several possible outcomes. The </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">may vanish as the character dies. Or the </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">may remain on the battlefield until the battle is over, fulfilling the ghost’s last wish. Most </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">are able to remain in the world only until the flesh of their decaying body falls from the bones. But occasionally the </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">remains on Earth indefinitely, single-mindedly seeking out those who killed the magician.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Such nemeses are usually unsuitable as player characters. Only their fixation on revenge allows them to remain in the world, which makes them unable to assist other player characters in stories unrelated to their vengeance. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">are also notably animalistic in their thinking, and so are rarely able to plausibly find ways of working patiently and methodically toward the downfall of their foe, as anthropomorphic ghosts sometimes can.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The character requires a prop that places him in a dissociated mental state. This is the hide of an animal in some groups. In others it is a drug, alcohol being particularly popular in some traditions. These characters take (10 – Concentration minutes) to enter the trance state and express the </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr — </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">far slower than conventional skinchangers — but they do not take a season to replace their prop if it is lost or stolen. Many reduce this time by arriving at battles so severely inebriated that they are on the very verge of insensibility, which shortens the time required to three rounds (drink, lie down, express </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">). While in the trance state, they are unaffected by inebriation and the trance state does not cease as the body neutralizes the drug.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">can be used for purposes other than battle. For example, bird </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">hamr </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">make excellent scouts.

Other foci are possible.</p><p> <strong>Animal</strong>: Birds, or mammals, or domesticated animals.</p><p> <strong>Aquam</strong>: Salt water or fresh water.</p><p> <strong>Auram</strong>: Weather.</p><p> <strong>Corpus</strong>: Men or women.</p><p> <strong>Herbam</strong>: Trees or food plants.</p><p> <strong>Imaginem</strong>: Visual images, auditory images, tactile images, or taste and smell together.</p><p> <strong>Mentem</strong>: Emotions or memories.</p><p> <strong>Terram</strong>: Metals or stone.</p><p> <strong>Necromancy</strong>: Corpus and Mentem as applied to the bodies and spirits of dead people.</p><p> <strong>Damage</strong>: Any Art, as long as the effect does damage directly, either by inflicting a wound or doing a certain amount of damage which can be soaked.</p><p> <strong>Disguise</strong>: Changing the appearance of something, by any means.</p><p> When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice. If a spell has requisites, the lowest applicable score may be one of the requisites, rather than one of the primary Arts. Thus, if a magus with a focus on birds was casting a spell to turn a bird into pure flame, MuAn (Ig), with Muto 14, An 18, and Ig 10, his final total would be 34 + other modifiers: 14 from Muto, and 20 from adding Ignem twice. If he was casting a spell to turn a bird into another sort of bird, MuAn with no requisites, his total would be 46 + other modifiers, 18 from Animal and 28 from adding Muto twice.</p><p> A character can have only one Magical Focus, either major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"major"},"indexKey":"major-magical-focus","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1729316634167,"modifiedTime":1731255711160,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM","exportSource":null},"folder":"ryEkrZYbf9tQGIrO","_id":"qED4cDuaKu0AfKbI","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

This Virtue lets the magus conceal spellcasting by using the actions or words of some Ability to replace the normal Hermetic gestures and words, and lets him maintain a spell without needing Concentration rolls. </p><p> When the Virtue is acquired, specify the Ability to which it applies. You may choose any Craft, Profession, or other Ability with a clear verbal or physical practice. You may not choose any Language, Supernatural, Academic, or Arcane Ability. </p><p> There are distinct Virtues for each possible Ability, as each allows different methods to work its actions into magic: knowing one method of Performance Magic does not let the magus use any other Ability in magic. </p><p> It is the action or words of the practice that are the focus of this Virtue, not the products of craft-working. An Ability that is <em>verbal </em>(such as storytelling) replaces the words of spellcasting; similarly, an Ability that is <em>physical </em>(such as hunting) replaces gestures. An Ability that encompasses both verbal and physical aspects (such as music, or mumming (acting)) allows the performer more flexibility. </p><p> The magus must actually perform the Ability to count as using this Virtue, and other Virtues or Mastery Abilities do not remove that requirement. For example, he cannot sing silently, although he <em>can </em>hunt silently. </p><p> Words or gestures that are not being replaced by Performance Magic remain as normal mystical components of spell-casting: use the normal rules and adjustments (including Virtues such as Quiet Magic and Mastery Abilities such as Still Casting). </p><p> <em>Example: Orlando is a musician and magus, and knows Sorcerous Music and Subtle Magic. He may cast spells while he sings (with no penalty for no gestures), plays his lute, or sings and plays. If he sings or plays quietly, he suffers the normal –5 penalty. He can cast spells silently, but only by not using Sorcerous Music. </em></p><p> <em>His friend Furioso, another Sorcerous Musician, lacks Subtle Magic. If he has no instrument with him, then, unlike Orlando, he must use normal Hermetic gestures or suffer the penalty for no gestures. </em></p><p> The magus may choose to vocalize loudly, or move exaggeratedly, and gain the equivalent bonuses as for loud words or exaggerated gestures. Bystanders may notice this as unusual activity, and take interest where they might not otherwise. </p><p> <strong>New Duration</strong>: <strong>Performance. </strong>The spell lasts as long as the caster performs the Performance Ability. Performance is equivalent to Concentration Duration. </p><p> To cast a Performance Duration spell, the magus must succeed in a roll (simple or stress die, according to circumstances) of Characteristic (varies with Ability) + Ability against an Ease Factor of 3. </p><p> The spell fails if this fails, and botches if the roll botches. The spell ends when the magus ceases to perform the Ability, but no Concentration or Ability rolls are needed to maintain the spell while the performance continues. </p><p> Formulaic spells must be devised with the new Duration to use this Ability; if so designed, the spell cannot be cast without performing. </p><p> <em>Example: Harold knows Performance Magic (Hunt), casts </em>Hunter’s Tracks of the Faerie Glow <em>(a variant of </em>Tracks of the Faerie Glow<em>), and succeeds with his simple Hunt roll. His magically enhanced vision persists as long as he keeps up the hunt, even if he is distracted by chatter or other spellcasting. </em></p><p> <em>Example: Orlando sings while he casts a </em>Sung Lamp Without Flame<em>. The light continues while he continues to sing, however badly, but ends when he stops singing. Needing to convey urgent instructions to a recalcitrant grog, he uses an enchanted device with Maintaining the Demanding Spell to maintain the spell while he stops to shout at the grog; before the Maintaining effect ends he resumes his sung performance.</em></p><p>See insert \"Performance Ablities\" page @@ </p><p><strong>Recognizing Performance Magic </strong></p><p> Most people do not recognize performing an Ability as spellcasting, so the performer may act more openly than most magi; even other Hermetic magi do not automatically recognize his actions. </p><p> If a Hermetic magus contemplates Fast Casting to oppose a spell and the caster is using Hermetic words and gestures, a magus may determine the Form automatically (page @@). In other circumstances, the magus must work the Form out. </p><p> <strong>Determining the Form of a Magical Effect: Stress Die + Perception + Awareness vs. 15 – effect magnitude </strong></p><p> If the spell is being cast with mundane words or gestures, the Ease Factor is adjusted as follows: </p><p> <strong>–</strong>3 if Hermetic words are spoken (and can be heard) </p><p> +0 if Hermetic gestures are made (and seen) </p><p> +3 if both words and gestures are mundane </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"minor"},"indexKey":"performance-magic","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.7","createdTime":1729673815476,"modifiedTime":1731255711164,"lastModifiedBy":"tBE5EmoIXLzf3maM","exportSource":null},"folder":"C8jqPqfblXk6hGCE","_id":"vCOD2vyibfFs9BnB","sort":4600000,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

{"name":"Mythic Alchemy","type":"virtue","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/VF/supernatural.svg","system":{"description":"<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This Virtue grants the character a score of 1 in the Mythic Alchemy Supernatural Ability. Mythic alchemists can actually transmute types of atoms into other types of atoms through the application of magical rather than philosophical techniques. This Ability always requires at least one season of activity in a properly outfitted alchemical laboratory. The rules described here depend on the rules for alchemists given in </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Art & Academe, </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Chapter 5: Experimental Philosophy.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Briefly, a formula is invented in a season by acquiring 5 experience points. Formulae are described like spells, with a single parameter called Alteration that describes the magnitude of the change. The formula is used to produce a reagent in a season using a Lab Total equal to Intelligence + Philosophiae, and the alchemist must accumulate points in excess of the formula’s level just like inventing a spell. Mythic alchemists are superior to their non-magical brethren in this, and they may add their Mythic Alchemy to their Lab Totals for creating any alchemical reagents.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Those with this Virtue can devise formulae that employ guidelines for alchemical reagents that are not available to those without the Virtue. The changes effected by Mythic Alchemy are permanent transmutations of the elements and result in non-magical substances, which cannot be dispelled. Alchemists without Mythic Alchemy always fail if they try to recreate these formulae from a Laboratory Text.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Learned magicians with the Mythic Alchemy Virtue may extract and transfer vis as described in </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">ArM5</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, page 94. The Mythic Alchemist uses his Succurro Magicam Lab Total to determine the number of pawns of Vim vis he may extract from a magical aura. Substitute the character’s score in Mythic Alchemy for Magic Theory to determine the number of pawns a character may use in a single season. Mythic Alchemists can also prepare the raw materials for a craftsman in such a way that the Ease Factor for creating Superior, Excellent, or Wondrous items is reduced; see </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">City & Guild</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, pages 63-73. The alchemist produces a reagent in the form of the primary component of the item to be created. For example, to create superior swords or armor, the alchemist would need to treat the metal used, but not the leather for the hilt or straps. The alchemist may prepare enough raw materials for a craftsman to use in one season (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">City & Guild</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, page 68). This process does not require vis. A Slight Alteration subtracts 1 from the Craft Ease Factor, a Minor Alteration subtracts 2, a Substantial Alteration subtracts 3, and a Major Alteration subtracts 4.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Transmuting a complex element into a similar sort of complex element is a </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Slight Alteration</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">if there is no change in the type of substance; for example, as in turning Welsh copper into Cornish copper (which has a slightly different luster). A </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Minor Alteration</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">can effect a transmutation of species; for example, base metal to base metal, or processed liquid to processed liquid. And a </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Substantial Alteration</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">can change genus; for example, base metal to noble metal, or oil into acid. </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Major Alterations</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">can affect higher categories of genus; so wood can be turned into tin, for example. Solids must remain solids, and liquids must remain liquids in any transmutation, and this is true when transmuting simple matter to complex matter and vice versa. Each dose of a transmutative reagent requires a pawn of Vim vis or vis of the appropriate Form for every 5 points (rounded up) of the reagent’s final level. A Mythic Alchemist can handle a number of pawns of vis in a season equal to twice his Mythic Alchemy score; and this may limit the number of doses he can produce regardless of his Lab Total or any Laboratory Texts.</span></p>","source":"HMRE","page":81,"indexKey":"mythic-alchemy","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","credits":"","type":"supernatural","impact":{"value":"major"},"hidden":false,"tainted":false},"effects":[],"folder":"a5lJqnaWGoCK0Bb9","flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0.16","createdTime":1757739788320,"modifiedTime":1757739788320,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J","exportSource":null},"_id":"zG5B2kTfoe7CeDy8","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

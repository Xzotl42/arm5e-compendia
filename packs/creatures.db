A demon can only use this Power when there is a chink in the armour of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increases it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.</p><p>Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind; these are listed under the creature's Powers.

Any other person who suffers as a result of his new personality trait must himself make a resistance roll against the initial Obsession Personality Trait, or succumb himself (and become a carrier himself). Thus, a man inflicted with Wrath by a demon infects his wife when he lashes out at her for burning his dinner, she then inflicts her neighbours with Wrath when they come to complain about the noise, and so on. For every victim who comes under the sway of the Obsession, the demon loses a point from its Might Pool, no matter how far away it is from the victim.

A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it).

An excellent swordsman and skilled outdoorsman, he is well known among the Muslim merchants and even Levantine Redcaps for his easy-going nature and bravado in defending caravans from raiders and brigands. Like most Faerie jinn<em>,</em> he can change into an animal form — in his case, a white wild Bactrian camel using his Skinchanger Virtue.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Although immune to Fatigue like other faeries, Jumayl is unusually susceptible to the effects of mundane alcohol ― a weakness that helps him to play his role within stories along the caravan routes. Unlike most faeries, his Might points, once spent, can only recover if he gets a full night's rest and eats a meal in the company of fellow travelers. This must be done within a human community, eating travel rations or caravanserai meals, drinking beverages fermented by humans and listening to humans sing or tell tales about their travels.

During his reign, several great Nibelungen heroes, including Siegfried himself, were loyal members of his court. When his uncle Ermenrik, German ruler of Rome, conquered Bern, Dietrich fled to the court of Attila the Hun, where he went on many adventures and became one of the greatest warriors in history. He returned after his uncle died, retook Bern and captured Rome. He died in a quest for revenge against a friend who betrayed him, and was buried in an ornate tomb in the Lessini Mountains, where the Alps cross over into Italy. His tomb is a treasure trove of weapons and armor, enchanted by being dipped in the blood of a great dragon Dietrich slew.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">When anyone enters the tomb, however, the Daimon of Dietrich animates his hulking corpse. If you come seeking wisdom and prove yourself worthy, he will dispense kingly advice. If you come seeking power, you will face one of the greatest warriors on Earth, even in death. Another legend propagated by the Church says Dietrich, a heretic suspected of Arianism, was thrown into the volcanic Mount Etna. The legend of Dietrich appears in <em>Das Heldenbuch</em> (“The Book of Heroes”) a collection of German romances published in the early 13th century, organizing the tales of the Ostrogoths and Franconians into two epic cycles.</p></div>","characteristics":{"int":{"value":2,"aging":0},"per":{"value":0,"aging":0},"str":{"value":5,"aging":0},"sta":{"value":5,"aging":0},"pre":{"value":5,"aging":0},"com":{"value":3,"aging":0},"dex":{"value":5,"aging":0},"qik":{"value":3,"aging":0}},"twilight":{"stage":0,"pointsGained":0,"strength":0,"complexity":0,"enigmaSpec":false,"concentrationSpec":false,"control":null,"year":null,"season":null},"vitals":{"siz":{"value":2},"soa":{"value":22},"enc":{"value":0}},"abilities":[],"weapons":[],"armor":[],"vis":[],"items":[],"spells":[],"magicalEffects":[],"laboratoryTexts":[],"reputations":[],"decrepitude":{"points":0,"effects":"Decrepitude effects","finalScore":null},"warping":{"points":0,"effects":"Warping effects","label":"Warping ","score":0,"finalScore":null},"familiar":{"nameFam":"","specieFam":"","techniqueFam":{"value":""},"formFam":{"value":""},"cordFam":{"bronze":0,"silver":0,"gold":0},"characteristicsFam":{"int":{"value":0},"per":{"value":0},"str":{"value":0},"sta":{"value":0},"pre":{"value":0},"com":{"value":0},"dex":{"value":0},"qik":{"value":0}},"vitalsFam":{"size":{"value":0},"might":{"value":0},"soak":{"value":0},"fatigue":{"value":0},"initiative":{"value":0},"attack":{"value":0},"defense":{"value":0},"damage":{"value":0}},"abilitiesFam":[],"powersFam":[]},"sanctum":{"value":"","actorId":null},"laboratory":{"longevityRitual":{"labTotal":0,"modifier":0,"twilightScars":""},"abilitiesSelected":{"finesse":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"awareness":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"concentration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"artesLib":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"philosophy":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"parma":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":"","speciality":""},"magicTheory":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"penetration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""}},"fastCastingSpeed":{"value":0,"sumary":"Qik + Finesse + stress die"},"determiningEffect":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Awareness + die VS 15-magnitude"},"targeting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Finesse + die"},"concentration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Sta + Concentration + die"},"magicResistance":{"value":0,"sumary":"Parma * 5 + Form"},"multipleCasting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Finesse + stress die - no of spells VS 9"},"basicLabTotal":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Magic theory + Aura (+ Technique + Form)"},"totalPenetration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Penetration + (Active effects penetration like Arcane connection or Sympathetic Connection)"},"visLimit":{"value":0,"sumary":"Magic theory * 2"}},"fatigueTotal":0,"fatigueCurrent":0,"fatigue":{"fresh":{"amount":0,"number":0},"winded":{"amount":1,"number":0},"weary":{"amount":1,"number":-1},"tired":{"amount":1,"number":-3},"dazed":{"amount":1,"number":-5},"unconscious":{"amount":1,"number":0}},"stances":{"voiceStance":"firm","gesturesStance":"bold"},"arts":{"techniques":{"cr":{"label":"Creo","xp":0},"in":{"label":"Intellego","xp":0},"mu":{"label":"Muto","xp":0},"pe":{"label":"Perdo","xp":0},"re":{"label":"Rego","xp":0}},"forms":{"an":{"label":"Animal","xp":0},"aq":{"label":"Aquam","xp":0},"au":{"label":"Auram","xp":0},"co":{"label":"Corpus","xp":0},"he":{"label":"Herbam","xp":0},"ig":{"label":"Ignem","xp":0},"im":{"label":"Imaginem","xp":0},"me":{"label":"Mentem","xp":0},"te":{"label":"Terram","xp":0},"vi":{"label":"Vim","xp":0}}},"apprentice":{"name":"","age":0,"years":0,"int":0,"magicTheory":0},"charType":{"value":"entity","label":"Char.

At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it).

Nevertheless, it is satisfied when mortals stay away from its slopes and live in a state of respectful fear, but should they become too bold, disrespectful, or forgetful, the genius loci will become irritated and its sleep will be disturbed. Its wrath gradually builds up until the need to vent its fury is overwhelming, at which point the volcano erupts with spectacular and devastating force.

When the Romans rose to prominence it was cast out by Vulcan, their god of fire and forge, but has since returned, and wreaks occasional and spectacular violent retribution on those who no longer either honor or fear it. A gateway to the Underworld was believed by the ancients to be situated beneath Etna. When using the Manifestation power, Adranus usually possesses one or more Sicilian eagles, the only creatures who will brave the mountain's heights.

A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it).

Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size –2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound.

He wears fine clothes in white and blue, and a crown of diamonds rests on his brow. He almost looks like a human being, but the authority in his voice belies that, as does the fact that literal ice water runs in his veins; when he bleeds, there are small crystals of ice in the water that flows out.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Lord Marsyne is the ruler of a faerie domain in the far north or in a range of high mountains. His home is a castle of fantastic beauty, made entirely of ice, and he has an extensive faerie retinue. Marsyne and his faeries act out an elaborate charade of the routines and festivals of mundane noble life, hunting strange creatures, holding tournaments, and even passing judgment on criminals within the court.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Most of the time, the court has little direct contact with humans. However, Lord Marsyne always has a human wife, and every so often he needs to find a new one. He always chooses a beautiful, young woman, and looks for some spark of creativity, independence, and spirit. He is quite taken by The Gift, and any beautiful, young Gifted woman in the area he is searching is very likely to be wooed. The wooing is utterly sincere, as the wife must return of her own free will.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Marsyne's wife plays an important role in the politics of the court, having her own set of faerie ladies-in-waiting and servants, and presiding over many of the tournaments. She also plays an important mystical role, as her presence and creativity allow the faeries to do new things. One thing she is not, is a physical wife to Lord Marsyne.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">As long as the wife follows the rules of the court, everything is fine. Marsyne makes her unaging, and protects her from the cold. If she breaks the rules, however, Marsyne judges her, entombs her in ice, and seeks out a new wife. He has many entombed wives, as some of the rules are along the lines of the classic \"Do not go into this room. Here is the key.\"</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">It is also possible for a wife to win her freedom, either through a successful challenge by an external champion, or through her own wits. Lord Marsyne remains fond of any wife who wins her freedom fairly, because that is part of the rules, but any who simply flee are brought back and entombed in the ice.</p></div>","characteristics":{"int":{"value":2,"aging":0},"per":{"value":0,"aging":0},"str":{"value":0,"aging":0},"sta":{"value":0,"aging":0},"pre":{"value":4,"aging":0},"com":{"value":1,"aging":0},"dex":{"value":0,"aging":0},"qik":{"value":0,"aging":0}},"twilight":{"stage":0,"pointsGained":0,"strength":0,"complexity":0,"enigmaSpec":false,"concentrationSpec":false,"control":null,"year":null,"season":null},"vitals":{"siz":{"value":0},"soa":{"value":25},"enc":{"value":0}},"abilities":[],"weapons":[],"armor":[],"vis":[],"items":[],"spells":[],"magicalEffects":[],"laboratoryTexts":[],"reputations":{"0":{"name":"Grants eternal youth"}},"decrepitude":{"points":0,"effects":"Decrepitude effects","finalScore":null},"warping":{"points":0,"effects":"Warping effects","label":"Warping ","score":0,"finalScore":null},"familiar":{"nameFam":"","specieFam":"","techniqueFam":{"value":""},"formFam":{"value":""},"cordFam":{"bronze":0,"silver":0,"gold":0},"characteristicsFam":{"int":{"value":0},"per":{"value":0},"str":{"value":0},"sta":{"value":0},"pre":{"value":0},"com":{"value":0},"dex":{"value":0},"qik":{"value":0}},"vitalsFam":{"size":{"value":0},"might":{"value":0},"soak":{"value":0},"fatigue":{"value":0},"initiative":{"value":0},"attack":{"value":0},"defense":{"value":0},"damage":{"value":0}},"abilitiesFam":[],"powersFam":[]},"sanctum":{"value":"","actorId":null},"laboratory":{"longevityRitual":{"labTotal":0,"modifier":0,"twilightScars":""},"abilitiesSelected":{"finesse":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"awareness":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"concentration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"artesLib":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"philosophy":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"parma":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":"","speciality":""},"magicTheory":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"penetration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""}},"fastCastingSpeed":{"value":0,"sumary":"Qik + Finesse + stress die"},"determiningEffect":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Awareness + die VS 15-magnitude"},"targeting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Finesse + die"},"concentration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Sta + Concentration + die"},"magicResistance":{"value":0,"sumary":"Parma * 5 + Form"},"multipleCasting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Finesse + stress die - no of spells VS 9"},"basicLabTotal":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Magic theory + Aura (+ Technique + Form)"},"totalPenetration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Penetration + (Active effects penetration like Arcane connection or Sympathetic Connection)"},"visLimit":{"value":0,"sumary":"Magic theory * 2"}},"fatigueTotal":0,"fatigueCurrent":0,"fatigue":{"fresh":{"amount":0,"number":0},"winded":{"amount":1,"number":0},"weary":{"amount":1,"number":-1},"tired":{"amount":1,"number":-3},"dazed":{"amount":1,"number":-5},"unconscious":{"amount":1,"number":0}},"stances":{"voiceStance":"firm","gesturesStance":"bold"},"arts":{"techniques":{"cr":{"label":"Creo","xp":0},"in":{"label":"Intellego","xp":0},"mu":{"label":"Muto","xp":0},"pe":{"label":"Perdo","xp":0},"re":{"label":"Rego","xp":0}},"forms":{"an":{"label":"Animal","xp":0},"aq":{"label":"Aquam","xp":0},"au":{"label":"Auram","xp":0},"co":{"label":"Corpus","xp":0},"he":{"label":"Herbam","xp":0},"ig":{"label":"Ignem","xp":0},"im":{"label":"Imaginem","xp":0},"me":{"label":"Mentem","xp":0},"te":{"label":"Terram","xp":0},"vi":{"label":"Vim","xp":0}}},"apprentice":{"name":"","age":0,"years":0,"int":0,"magicTheory":0},"charType":{"value":"entity","label":"Char.

He is plump, but not fat, and while he never appears positively cheerful, he also never seems angry, or impatient, at least not with other merchants. His clothes are of excellent quality and taste.</p><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Bartholomew is a well-established and moderately successful merchant in a trading city. He is known for being lazy, but still making an extremely comfortable living from his trade. He also willingly gives advice to other merchants, and they have noticed that following his advice makes them rich, while disregarding it makes them poor. Most people in the city also think that Bartholomew attends church regularly. In fact, being a demon, he has never set foot inside a consecrated building. He has, on the other hand, made substantial donations to the Church, and those donations are well known.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The advice he gives is good business advice in itself, but he normally backs it up with his blessings, at least for a while. If his advice is ignored, he uses his curses to make sure that people suffer. The demonic features of his advice are very, very subtle. Merchants following them often find that they need to work on Sundays, although Bartholomew does not explicitly suggest that, and that they are often away from home on religious holidays, and thus unable to attend their local church. Further, he gives advice about charity, suggesting that the merchant give money away to reinforce his social standing. He also gives extensive advice on how to calculate how much to give, so that it doesn't cause the merchant financial problems.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This has the effect of making the merchant feel that he is doing a lot of good by giving alms, while removing any actual virtue it has. Anyone following Bartholomew's advice gives only for their own glory, and thus earns no merit. They are sinners, but they don't realize that they are, and thus they do not see the need to repent and reform. Bartholomew's strategy is subtle, but it wins many souls for Hell.</p><p><strong>Vis:</strong> 10 pawns of Mentem vis, one in each of his fingers.

The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write.

A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

A demon can only use this Power when there is a chink in the armour of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increases it by one if he already possesses it).

The wolf can bark, but its better-known sound is its eerie, piercing howl.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The wolf is found throughout Mythic Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. According to Pliny the Elder, the wolves of northern regions are fierce while those of Africa and Egypt are weak</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Wolves are greatly feared by commoners. They are hunted with large hounds because they kill livestock. In some lands, there is a bounty on their hides. Many tales attribute supernatural powers to wolves, but most wolves are mundane and have no powers at all.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The Flaws above reflect the medieval perception of the wolf as a wanton, bloodthirsty killer. Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion. A wolf Animal Companion that goes around killing livestock could be disruptive to stories. Regardless of such a wolf's actual personality, mundanes are likely to treat it with a great deal of fear and suspicion.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The leader of a wolf pack has the additional Ability, Leadership 5 (wolves).

At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost.

Obsession is resolved in the usual way, except that if the target fails his personality roll, he becomes contagious. Any other person who suffers as a result of his new personality trait must himself make a resistance roll against the initial Obsession Personality Trait, or succumb himself (and become a carrier himself). Thus, a man inflicted with Wrath by a demon infects his wife when he lashes out at her for burning his dinner, she then inflicts her neighbours with Wrath when they come to complain about the noise, and so on. For every victim who comes under the sway of the Obsession, the demon loses a point from its Might Pool, no matter how far away it is from the victim. When the demon has no Might Pool left, the obsession ceases to be contagious, although those who have suffered it remain inflicted with the Personality Trait, as usual. The contagion also ends if a day passes with- out a new victim succumbing to the Obsession. Powerful Obsessions can quickly go out of control, as the rate of infection of new victims exceeds the regeneration rate of the demon's Might Pool.</p>","source":"RoP:I","page":0,"indexKey":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","form":"me","cost":1,"init":0,"penetration":0,"realm":"mundane"},"_id":"PPFWQDiCSvWzvSD4","img":"icons/svg/tower.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"eqndtomCCLEtzedn":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0.4","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"exportSource":null}}],"effects":[],"folder":"922DwHk6VGdEBAul","ownership":{"default":0,"ErQ613O32LNYb71L":3},"flags":{"arm5e":{}},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.351","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.0.4","createdTime":1748672049249,"modifiedTime":1761251587732,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J","exportSource":{"worldId":"novgorod","uuid":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.29"}},"_id":"2OSJ8dGQdPPaGIKt","sort":500000}

If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind; these Personality Traits are listed under the creature's powers.

An excellent swordsman and skilled outdoorsman, he is well known among the Muslim merchants and even Levantine Redcaps for his easy-going nature and bravado in defending caravans from raiders and brigands. Like most Faerie jinn<em>,</em> he can change into an animal form — in his case, a white wild Bactrian camel using his Skinchanger Virtue.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Although immune to Fatigue like other faeries, Jumayl is unusually susceptible to the effects of mundane alcohol ― a weakness that helps him to play his role within stories along the caravan routes. Unlike most faeries, his Might points, once spent, can only recover if he gets a full night's rest and eats a meal in the company of fellow travelers. This must be done within a human community, eating travel rations or caravanserai meals, drinking beverages fermented by humans and listening to humans sing or tell tales about their travels.

He returned after his uncle died, retook Bern and captured Rome. He died in a quest for revenge against a friend who betrayed him, and was buried in an ornate tomb in the Lessini Mountains, where the Alps cross over into Italy. His tomb is a treasure trove of weapons and armor, enchanted by being dipped in the blood of a great dragon Dietrich slew.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">When anyone enters the tomb, however, the Daimon of Dietrich animates his hulking corpse.

At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it).

It has developed an antipathy towards the local peoples, since they long ago ceased worshipping it as a god. Nevertheless, it is satisfied when mortals stay away from its slopes and live in a state of respectful fear, but should they become too bold, disrespectful, or forgetful, the genius loci will become irritated and its sleep will be disturbed. Its wrath gradually builds up until the need to vent its fury is overwhelming, at which point the volcano erupts with spectacular and devastating force. Those few who venture onto the blasted and rocky slopes of the mountain have been known to go insane.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">In ancient times, Adranus was worshiped by the primitive inhabitants of Sicily as a god of fire. When the Romans rose to prominence it was cast out by Vulcan, their god of fire and forge, but has since returned, and wreaks occasional and spectacular violent retribution on those who no longer either honor or fear it. A gateway to the Underworld was believed by the ancients to be situated beneath Etna. When using the Manifestation power, Adranus usually possesses one or more Sicilian eagles, the only creatures who will brave the mountain's heights. The volcano last erupted in 1194, and, if your saga follows real history, will next erupt in 1222.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Mount Etna is a conical and blasted peak that rises ten thousand feet above the eastern end of the island of Sicily.</p></div><p><strong>Vis:</strong> 10 pawns of Ignem vis; 5 pawns per year can also be harvested from the crater at the volcano's summit.</p>","characteristics":{"int":{"value":3,"aging":0},"per":{"value":0,"aging":0},"str":{"value":3,"aging":0},"sta":{"value":2,"aging":0},"pre":{"value":2,"aging":0},"com":{"value":2,"aging":0},"dex":{"value":-1,"aging":0},"qik":{"value":-2,"aging":0}},"twilight":{"stage":0,"pointsGained":0,"strength":0,"complexity":0,"enigmaSpec":false,"concentrationSpec":false,"control":null,"year":null,"season":null},"vitals":{"siz":{"value":0},"soa":{"value":2},"enc":{"value":0}},"abilities":[],"weapons":[],"armor":[],"vis":[],"items":[],"spells":[],"magicalEffects":[],"laboratoryTexts":[],"reputations":{"0":{"name":"Bringer of Death and Destruction"}},"decrepitude":{"points":0,"effects":"Decrepitude effects","finalScore":null},"warping":{"points":0,"effects":"Warping effects","label":"Warping ","score":0,"finalScore":null},"familiar":{"nameFam":"","specieFam":"","techniqueFam":{"value":""},"formFam":{"value":""},"cordFam":{"bronze":0,"silver":0,"gold":0},"characteristicsFam":{"int":{"value":0},"per":{"value":0},"str":{"value":0},"sta":{"value":0},"pre":{"value":0},"com":{"value":0},"dex":{"value":0},"qik":{"value":0}},"vitalsFam":{"size":{"value":0},"might":{"value":0},"soak":{"value":0},"fatigue":{"value":0},"initiative":{"value":0},"attack":{"value":0},"defense":{"value":0},"damage":{"value":0}},"abilitiesFam":[],"powersFam":[]},"sanctum":{"value":"","actorId":null},"laboratory":{"longevityRitual":{"labTotal":0,"modifier":0,"twilightScars":""},"abilitiesSelected":{"finesse":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"awareness":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"concentration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"artesLib":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"philosophy":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"parma":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":"","speciality":""},"magicTheory":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"penetration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""}},"fastCastingSpeed":{"value":0,"sumary":"Qik + Finesse + stress die"},"determiningEffect":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Awareness + die VS 15-magnitude"},"targeting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Finesse + die"},"concentration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Sta + Concentration + die"},"magicResistance":{"value":0,"sumary":"Parma * 5 + Form"},"multipleCasting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Finesse + stress die - no of spells VS 9"},"basicLabTotal":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Magic theory + Aura (+ Technique + Form)"},"totalPenetration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Penetration + (Active effects penetration like Arcane connection or Sympathetic Connection)"},"visLimit":{"value":0,"sumary":"Magic theory * 2"}},"fatigueTotal":0,"fatigueCurrent":0,"longTermFatigue":0,"fatigue":{"fresh":{"amount":0,"number":0},"winded":{"amount":1,"number":0},"weary":{"amount":1,"number":-1},"tired":{"amount":1,"number":-3},"dazed":{"amount":1,"number":-5},"unconscious":{"amount":1,"number":0}},"stances":{"voiceStance":"firm","gesturesStance":"bold"},"arts":{"techniques":{"cr":{"label":"Creo","xp":0},"in":{"label":"Intellego","xp":0},"mu":{"label":"Muto","xp":0},"pe":{"label":"Perdo","xp":0},"re":{"label":"Rego","xp":0}},"forms":{"an":{"label":"Animal","xp":0},"aq":{"label":"Aquam","xp":0},"au":{"label":"Auram","xp":0},"co":{"label":"Corpus","xp":0},"he":{"label":"Herbam","xp":0},"ig":{"label":"Ignem","xp":0},"im":{"label":"Imaginem","xp":0},"me":{"label":"Mentem","xp":0},"te":{"label":"Terram","xp":0},"vi":{"label":"Vim","xp":0}}},"apprentice":{"name":"","age":0,"years":0,"int":0,"magicTheory":0},"charType":{"value":"entity","label":"Char.

A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.</span></p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"internal-embed markdown-embed is-loaded\">Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind; these Personality Traits are listed under the creature's powers.

The largest dogs are used for guarding livestock or hunting dangerous beasts like wolves, bears, and wild boars. They include the breeds like the bloodhound, elkhound, Rottweiler, mastiff, and great Dane. Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size –2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound. Several breeds that are popular in the real world, such as the German shepherd and most retrievers, did not exist in the Middle Ages. These statistics are for the bloodhound, and the Characteristics of other breeds may be different.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">All dogs have a good sense of smell, and the bloodhound's sense is so keen it gets a +3 bonus to all related rolls.

He wears fine clothes in white and blue, and a crown of diamonds rests on his brow. He almost looks like a human being, but the authority in his voice belies that, as does the fact that literal ice water runs in his veins; when he bleeds, there are small crystals of ice in the water that flows out.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Lord Marsyne is the ruler of a faerie domain in the far north or in a range of high mountains. His home is a castle of fantastic beauty, made entirely of ice, and he has an extensive faerie retinue. Marsyne and his faeries act out an elaborate charade of the routines and festivals of mundane noble life, hunting strange creatures, holding tournaments, and even passing judgment on criminals within the court.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Most of the time, the court has little direct contact with humans. However, Lord Marsyne always has a human wife, and every so often he needs to find a new one. He always chooses a beautiful, young woman, and looks for some spark of creativity, independence, and spirit. He is quite taken by The Gift, and any beautiful, young Gifted woman in the area he is searching is very likely to be wooed. The wooing is utterly sincere, as the wife must return of her own free will.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Marsyne's wife plays an important role in the politics of the court, having her own set of faerie ladies-in-waiting and servants, and presiding over many of the tournaments. She also plays an important mystical role, as her presence and creativity allow the faeries to do new things. One thing she is not, is a physical wife to Lord Marsyne.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">As long as the wife follows the rules of the court, everything is fine. Marsyne makes her unaging, and protects her from the cold. If she breaks the rules, however, Marsyne judges her, entombs her in ice, and seeks out a new wife.

His clothes are of excellent quality and taste.</p><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Bartholomew is a well-established and moderately successful merchant in a trading city. He is known for being lazy, but still making an extremely comfortable living from his trade. He also willingly gives advice to other merchants, and they have noticed that following his advice makes them rich, while disregarding it makes them poor. Most people in the city also think that Bartholomew attends church regularly. In fact, being a demon, he has never set foot inside a consecrated building. He has, on the other hand, made substantial donations to the Church, and those donations are well known.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The advice he gives is good business advice in itself, but he normally backs it up with his blessings, at least for a while. If his advice is ignored, he uses his curses to make sure that people suffer. The demonic features of his advice are very, very subtle. Merchants following them often find that they need to work on Sundays, although Bartholomew does not explicitly suggest that, and that they are often away from home on religious holidays, and thus unable to attend their local church. Further, he gives advice about charity, suggesting that the merchant give money away to reinforce his social standing. He also gives extensive advice on how to calculate how much to give, so that it doesn't cause the merchant financial problems.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">This has the effect of making the merchant feel that he is doing a lot of good by giving alms, while removing any actual virtue it has. Anyone following Bartholomew's advice gives only for their own glory, and thus earns no merit. They are sinners, but they don't realize that they are, and thus they do not see the need to repent and reform. Bartholomew's strategy is subtle, but it wins many souls for Hell.</p><p><strong>Vis:</strong> 10 pawns of Mentem vis, one in each of his fingers.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write.

A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it).

Its coat is either grey or black in color.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The destrier, or heavy war horse, has been bred in Mythic Europe since at least the time of Charles Martel (8th century A.D.).

These horses are used mainly for battle; farm work is done using oxen.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The destrier is almost always a stallion.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

A demon can only use this Power when there is a chink in the armour of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increases it by one if he already possesses it).

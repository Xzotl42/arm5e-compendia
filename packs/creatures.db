Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion.

A demon can only use this Power when there is a chink in the armour of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increases it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.</p><p>Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind; these are listed under the creature's Powers.

Any other person who suffers as a result of his new personality trait must himself make a resistance roll against the initial Obsession Personality Trait, or succumb himself (and become a carrier himself). Thus, a man inflicted with Wrath by a demon infects his wife when he lashes out at her for burning his dinner, she then inflicts her neighbours with Wrath when they come to complain about the noise, and so on. For every victim who comes under the sway of the Obsession, the demon loses a point from its Might Pool, no matter how far away it is from the victim.

Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size –2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound.

A demon can only use this Power when there is a chink in the armour of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At such moments, the demon can impose its Obsession Trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might Points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; the result must be lower than a simple roll + any other suit- able opposed Personality Trait to success- fully resist the impulses. (A second trait which is similar to the imposed trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's Power has failed and the Obsession Trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increases it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.</p><p>Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind; these are listed under the creature's Powers.

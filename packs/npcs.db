This translates into a total of 20 experience points each year, which is gained as follows:* Two seasons of being taught, assuming a quality of 7, for a total of 14 experience points across one or two Abilities * One season of practice, assuming a quality of 4, in one martial Ability * One season of exposure, giving 2 experience points in an Ability appropriate to running his estate, such as the local language, or in Order of Hermes Lore as he begins to learn more about his Hermetic neighbors.After improving his grasp of Latin, he gains tuition in the four realm lore Abilities as soon as he is able, which requires suitable tutors. But one thing he cannot do is learn any of the Supernatural Abilities that his guests bring to his court. It is a source of frustration to him, but he contents himself by retaining those with gifts so that he may call upon them at will. In truth, as driven as he is to learn about magic, he is too much the master of his domain to serve as the apprentice that the various initiations demand. And so they fail.* The bonuses for superior arms and armor have been factored into the combat statistics above.'The statistics below represent Geoffroi at the beginning of his journey, just as his fascination begins. As a mundane opponent he poses little personal threat to magi and his Ability scores change little throughout their entanglements, with the notable exception of his increasing knowledge of the supernatural realms.</p><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> full chain armor,long sword,heater shield *,Great sword,an appropriate horse for every occasion</p>","source":"Ant","page":0,"indexKey":"baron-geoffroi-darques","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"xzotl","age":{"value":32},"apparent":{"dtype":"Number","value":32},"con":{"label":"Confidence ","score":1,"points":3},"covenant":{"value":"Covenant Name","actorId":null,"name":"Covenant Name"},"realms":{"magic":{"aligned":false,"susceptible":false},"faeric":{"aligned":false,"susceptible":false},"divine":{"aligned":false,"susceptible":false},"infernal":{"aligned":false,"susceptible":false}},"states":{"pendingCrisis":false,"creationMode":true,"confidencePrompt":false,"pendingDamage":false},"combatPreps":{"current":"custom","list":{"custom":{"ids":[],"name":"Custom"}}},"biography":"<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Smart, clean-shaven, erect, and conspicuously wealthy, he wears the finest of everything, from his armor to his traveling clothes, from the sword at his waist to the gold rings upon his fingers.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

A bony figure swathed in a black, all-encompassing robe and carrying a black-hafted spear, he is reminiscent of medieval perceptions of the physical embodiment of death. This image is further emphasized if his hood falls away from his face, for Darius is bald, with a mass of scar tissue for a face and no eyes.</p><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Darius is content to cultivate his sinister image; he is a hoplite and an expert with Perdo magic, dedicated to the discovery and execution of traitors within the Order. However, it was not always thus; Uwe, the boy who would eventually become Darius, was born into a merchant family living in Bavaria. He enjoyed a comfortable life in a moderately prosperous household. However, shortly after Uwe reached puberty strange things began to happen. His books would fall apart, furniture he sat on would break, and the family cat died in his arms. His family became aware that there was something unsettling about the boy and were only too happy to see him taken away as an apprentice by the mysterious scholar who visited them soon after.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Thus Uwe became the apprentice of the hoplite Xerxes, who indoctrinated his filius to become a hunter of evils within the Order of Hermes. A lab accident early during apprenticeship burned away Uwe’s eyes and the flesh on his head, but Xerxes restored Uwe’s sight, although he refused to do anything about his filius’ appearance. Fifteen years later Uwe became a magus of the Order of Hermes named Darius and joined the ranks of the hoplites, its guardians. He has continued to maintain contact with his (aging) pater, but they only see each other on rare occasions when they can share information; Xerxes is now too frail to take part in combat.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">Darius travelled to the covenant to establish a base from which he could seek out and destroy its enemies. He pursued this vocation with an enthusiasm that impressed his colleagues, and when the previous leader of the covenant recently passed into Final Twilight he accepted the position of head, seeing in this an opportunity to instill his values into the new, younger members swelling its ranks. Darius has been too busy to train an apprentice, but now he feels the need to pass on his legacy soon, as he suspects that he may have encountered his bane; he recently fought a powerful Renounced magus and his followers and was nearly killed, only “escaping” when a magical maelstrom sent him physically into Twilight. The traitor is still at large; Darius intends to kill him in the next confrontation and is even prepared to sacrifice himself to achieve this aim.</p></div>","characteristics":{"int":{"value":3,"aging":0},"per":{"value":1,"aging":0},"str":{"value":2,"aging":0},"sta":{"value":0,"aging":0},"pre":{"value":-3,"aging":3},"com":{"value":-1,"aging":0},"dex":{"value":1,"aging":0},"qik":{"value":2,"aging":0}},"twilight":{"stage":0,"pointsGained":0,"strength":0,"complexity":0,"enigmaSpec":false,"concentrationSpec":false,"control":null,"year":null,"season":null},"vitals":{"siz":{"value":0},"soa":{"value":0},"enc":{"value":0}},"abilities":[],"weapons":[],"armor":[],"vis":[],"items":[],"spells":[],"magicalEffects":[],"laboratoryTexts":[],"reputations":{"0":{"name":"Dedicated Hoplite"}},"decrepitude":{"points":2,"effects":"Decrepitude effects","finalScore":0},"warping":{"points":124,"effects":"Warping effects","finalScore":6},"fatigueTotal":0,"fatigueCurrent":0,"longTermFatigue":0,"fatigue":{"fresh":{"amount":0,"number":0},"winded":{"amount":1,"number":0},"weary":{"amount":1,"number":-1},"tired":{"amount":1,"number":-3},"dazed":{"amount":1,"number":-5},"unconscious":{"amount":1,"number":0}},"stances":{"voiceStance":"firm","gesturesStance":"bold"},"arts":{"techniques":{"cr":{"label":"Creo","xp":55,"finalScore":10},"in":{"label":"Intellego","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"mu":{"label":"Muto","xp":10,"finalScore":4},"pe":{"label":"Perdo","xp":124,"finalScore":21},"re":{"label":"Rego","xp":45,"finalScore":9}},"forms":{"an":{"label":"Animal","xp":15,"finalScore":5},"aq":{"label":"Aquam","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"au":{"label":"Auram","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"co":{"label":"Corpus","xp":120,"finalScore":15},"he":{"label":"Herbam","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"ig":{"label":"Ignem","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"im":{"label":"Imaginem","xp":15,"finalScore":5},"me":{"label":"Mentem","xp":21,"finalScore":6},"te":{"label":"Terram","xp":25,"finalScore":6},"vi":{"label":"Vim","xp":36,"finalScore":8}}},"familiar":{"nameFam":"","specieFam":"","techniqueFam":{"value":"cr"},"formFam":{"value":"an"},"cordFam":{"bronze":null,"silver":null,"gold":null},"characteristicsFam":{"int":{"value":0},"per":{"value":0},"str":{"value":0},"sta":{"value":0},"pre":{"value":0},"com":{"value":0},"dex":{"value":0},"qik":{"value":0}},"vitalsFam":{"size":{"value":0},"might":{"value":0},"soak":{"value":0},"fatigue":{"value":0},"initiative":{"value":0},"attack":{"value":0},"defense":{"value":0},"damage":{"value":0}},"abilitiesFam":[],"powersFam":[]},"sanctum":{"value":"","actorId":null},"laboratory":{"longevityRitual":{"labTotal":0,"modifier":0,"twilightScars":"The shadows in Darius' hood are unusually deep, hiding his face; Nearby, non-magical items decay when Darius uses magic (as the Warped Magic Flaw)."},"abilitiesSelected":{"finesse":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"awareness":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"concentration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"artesLib":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"philosophy":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"parma":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":"","speciality":""},"magicTheory":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""},"penetration":{"abilityID":"","value":0,"label":""}},"fastCastingSpeed":{"value":0,"sumary":"Qik + Finesse + stress die"},"determiningEffect":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Awareness + die VS 15-magnitude"},"targeting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Per + Finesse + die"},"concentration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Sta + Concentration + die"},"magicResistance":{"value":0,"sumary":"Parma * 5 + Form"},"multipleCasting":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Finesse + stress die - no of spells VS 9"},"basicLabTotal":{"value":0,"sumary":"Int + Magic theory + Aura (+ Technique + Form)"},"totalPenetration":{"value":0,"sumary":"Penetration + (Active effects penetration like Arcane connection or Sympathetic Connection)"},"visLimit":{"value":0,"sumary":"Magic theory * 2"}},"apprentice":{"name":"","age":0,"years":0,"int":0,"magicTheory":0},"magicSystem":{"name":"","adjective":"","practitioner":"","effects":"","laboratory":"","realm":"mundane"},"features":{"magicSystem":false,"powers":false},"charType":{"value":"magus","label":"Char.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Some elementalists might call this an incorrect description of their powers, since it may seem to them that they create these elements from nothing rather than bringing them to the caster from somewhere else. However, the basic principle is that the four elements are all part of nature, and so may always be found nearby and used to produce a supernatural effect. Summoning relies upon the character’s Stamina, his score in Summoning added to the appropriate Elementalist Form, plus the local aura and a stress die roll. This procedure always <strong>costs the elementalist a long-term Fatigue level</strong>, and takes anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the proximity of the summoned target. If successful, the target will appear directly beside the elementalist, within his immediate reach.</p><p><strong>Summoning Total: Stress Die + Stamina + Summoning + (Form) + Aura</strong></p><p>This is compared to the following chart to determine the maximum Size and Might of the target. The Total must always be great enough to affect both the Size and Might of the target. For example, a target of Size –6 and Might 20 would need a Summoning Total of 20 because of its Might, while another the size of a warhorse (+3) with only Might 5 would still require a Summoning Total of 20 because of its Size. A Summoning Total of 10 can only affect a target as large as a cat (–3) with a Might Score of 10 or less, for instance.</p><p><strong>Total Might Size  Note</strong></p><p>0       0    –21  nonexistent<br>1       1    –18  too small to perceive<br>2       2    –15  insect, kernel of grain<br>3       3    –12  baby mouse, 10 insects<br>4       4    –9   bat, frog 5 5 –6 lizard, stoat<br>10     10    –3   badger, cat<br>15     15     0   adult, ten cats<br>20     20    +3   war horse, ten adults<br>25     25    +6   killer whale, 100 adults<br>30     30    +9   humpbacked whale, 100 horses<br>35     35    +12  tower, castle<br>40     40    +15  village, storm<br>45     45    +18  city, river<br>50     50    +21  mountain, sea</p><p>Summoning may be used in one of three different ways, depending upon the type of elemental magic the character learned: Medicinal, Philosophical, or Theurgical (see later). The elementalist may attempt to include multiple elements when Summoning, as long as he possesses all of the Forms used in the formula. For example, an elemental philosopher with Elementalist Air and Elementalist Fire might want to summon an animal with either or both a sanguine or choleric temperament. Use the lower of his two Form scores (Elementalist Air or Elementalist Fire in this case) to determine if he is successful. If this would summon one of several different targets that fit both criteria (for example, there are both sanguine and choleric animals nearby, but no animals that are both sanguine and choleric), the results should favor the element in which he has a higher score. The elementalist may prepare a magical container for his target, if he wishes, by tracing the perimeter of the area in which the target will be held. Summoning circles drawn into the floor are very common containers, though jars and bottles are also used often as they are more transportable. Like a magus drawing a ring (see ArM5 page 112), a magical container may require the elementalist to maintain concentration while performing the summoning, but doing so ensures that the summoned target cannot leave the area for as long as the boundary is undisturbed. If the seal is broken, either by opening the container or breaking the circle, the target of the summoning is free to go wherever it desires. However, as long as the elementalist has a bound captive, he does not recover the long-term Fatigue levels spent to summon it. Thus, elementalists rarely bind more than two or three targets at a time. A summoning container also makes it easier for the elementalist to affect a summoned</p><p>supernatural being with his other Elementalist Techniques, since it lessens the difficulty of penetrating its resistance with those powers as long as the target is held within the container into which it was summoned. If the target has been summoned and successfully bound into a ring or container using the Summoning Art, treat the level of successive effects with the Elementalist Arts as if they were 0, and apply the entire casting total toward the Penetration Total. It is as if the later effect is incorporated into the original Summoning effect, so that the elementalist only needs to penetrate the target’s resistance once. Botching the summoning roll means the elementalist has lost control of his power. The summoned being may appear but without any safeguards, or a different sort of being (such as an angel or demon) is attracted instead. Or, perhaps the elementalist simply channeled too much elemental power through himself, and his bodily humors become imbalanced, making him sick or injured.</p><p></p>"},"LvKCMpkfzsHUw01u":{"name":"Controlling","useFatigue":true,"components":[{"type":"char","characteristic":"pre","compIdx":0,"partial":"systems/arm5e/templates/actor/parts/template-item-char.hbs","selection":{"int":"Intelligence (1)","per":"Perception (0)","str":"Strength (0)","sta":"Stamina (2)","pre":"Presence (2)","com":"Communication (0)","dex":"Dexterity (0)","qik":"Quickness (0)"}},{"type":"verb","option":"Theurgical-Controlling","key":"technique","extendedKey":"technique_Theurgical-Controlling","compIdx":1,"selection":{"any":"Any","Theological-Summoning":"Theological Summoning (0)","Theurgical-Controlling":"Theurgical Controlling (0)"},"partial":"systems/arm5e/templates/actor/parts/template-item-tech.hbs"},{"type":"noun","option":"any","key":"form"}],"rollType":"1"}}},"realm":"magic"},"items":[{"name":"Tutor at York Cathedral School","type":"reputation","img":"icons/svg/angel.svg","system":{"xp":5,"type":"academic","description":"","source":"custom","page":0,"indexKey":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","credits":""},"_id":"TNWrJLf6jytRaZi7","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.343","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.4.1.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"name":"Artes Liberales","type":"ability","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/abilities/artesLib.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6v8nsyfy","path":"Abilities#/CF_SEP/Academic","color":"#000000"}},"system":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education.

The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write.

His first year with the baron was a troubled time, and Claude resented both his master's wealth and his own subservient position. He angered many, treated others with contempt and scant regard, and made few friends. One evening he was set upon by persons unknown. He was severely beaten and would have been killed but for Divine intervention. An angel enfolded him in its light and confronted Claude with the mistakes that had brought him so low. This event changed Claude's life forever. He reaffirmed his loyalty to Geoffroi, put aside his wayward habits, and dedicated himself to his duties. And in return, the angel promised that Claude would be protected from the world so long as he remained true. Those in Geoffroi's household now barely remember Claude as he was and only pay respect to the man he has become: loyal and temperate.* Claude's soak score includes the +5 bonus granted by his guardian angel.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion.

Regardless of such a wolf's actual personality, mundanes are likely to treat it with a great deal of fear and suspicion.</p></div><div class=\"el-p\"><p dir=\"auto\">The leader of a wolf pack has the additional Ability, Leadership 5 (wolves).

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument.

A character with The Gift, even if he is not a magus, may take Hermetic Virtues and Flaws which relate to intrinsic ability rather than background or training. Characters may take Virtues that grant Supernatural Abilities without taking The Gift, and such characters do not suffer the penalties imposed by The Gift. However, such characters may not learn new Supernatural Abilities in the course of the saga, although they may improve the ones they already have. It is possible for unGifted characters to Initiate new Supernatural Abilities through a Mystery Cult, but even this is harder for them than for the Gifted.</p><p>Characters who have The Gift may start play with a single Supernatural Ability, without having to take any other Virtue, but if they wish to learn others they must find opportunities to do so in the course of the saga. They may also take Virtues granting Supernatural Abilities if they wish to have more Abilities at character creation. Note that it is harder for a character with Supernatural Abilities to become a Hermetic magus (see Training Your Apprentice on page @@), so you may not wish to take any such abilities if you plan for the character to become an apprentice. The ability to cast Hermetic magic is the single supernatural ability possessed by Hermetic magi in virtue of The Gift again, they may take more Supernatural Ability Virtues if they wish.</p><p>Grogs can never have The Gift, as a character with The Gift is too important to be a grog. As a rule, companions should only have The Gift if they are intended to become magi, or if they are members of one of the other magical traditions described in <strong>Ars Magica 5</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Edition</strong> supplements. Troupes should not allow any other Gifted characters unless they are absolutely sure that they want them.</p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":43,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"free"},"indexKey":"the-gift","review_status":"definitiveReady","reviewer":"Xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null},"folder":"umvpyTZt5f5tEdND","_id":"3yM1DawUa4jWvQs3","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3,"wUH1ww0o0zQEBtKr":3}},{"name":"Hermetic Magus","type":"virtue","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/VF/social.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_kuhc1tso94g","path":"Virtues#/CF_SEP/Social Status","color":"#000000"}},"system":{"description":"<p>You are a member of the Order of Hermes.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Characters may take Virtues that grant Supernatural Abilities without taking The Gift, and such characters do not suffer the penalties imposed by The Gift.

Note that it is harder for a character with Supernatural Abilities to become a Hermetic magus (see Training Your Apprentice on page @@), so you may not wish to take any such abilities if you plan for the character to become an apprentice.

The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

(Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write.

The largest dogs are used for guarding livestock or hunting dangerous beasts like wolves, bears, and wild boars. They include the breeds like the bloodhound, elkhound, Rottweiler, mastiff, and great Dane. Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size –2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound. Several breeds that are popular in the real world, such as the German shepherd and most retrievers, did not exist in the Middle Ages.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument.

If he was casting a spell to turn a bird into another sort of bird, MuAn with no requisites, his total would be 46 + other modifiers, 18 from Animal and 28 from adding Muto twice.</p><p> A character can have only one Magical Focus, either major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"major"},"indexKey":"major-magical-focus","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null},"folder":"ryEkrZYbf9tQGIrO","_id":"86AzveDIwMQ6eRvZ","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3,"wUH1ww0o0zQEBtKr":3}},{"name":"Enduring Magic","type":"virtue","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/VF/hermetic.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_nxctmjlqqdb","path":"Virtues#/CF_SEP/Hermetic","color":"#000000"}},"system":{"description":"<p>The effects of your spells tend to last longer than usual (though Concentration, Momentary, and Ring spells remain just that).

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Criamon apprentices learn to view events and objects in unusual and intuitive ways, usually by meditating on 15 riddles related to the Arts. This training helps them to find connections between concepts, and place this knowledge into the context of the Enigma. This in turn allows Criamon magi to understand the nature of humans, the universe, and the ties between them in ways incomprehensible to other magi. Once a magus has grasped the foundational elements of wisdom, he may develop deeper understanding by considering the insights of others, which can be transmitted through books, discussion, or mystical experiences.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 6pt; text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Symbolic Understanding</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">A Criamon magus may use his Enigmatic Wisdom score to understand subtle symbols.

A labyrinth meditation is a non-magical ritual during which the magus walks slowly through a maze while contemplating a problem. Many contemplation mazes are simple ribbons, with a single path leading to a center, then out again. Simple contemplative labyrinths can be created with low-level spells.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus&rsquo;s mental state remains focused for an hour after he completes the labyrinth. This allows a bonus on a single roll. This can be used to untangle a single conundrum (an Enigmatic Wisdom roll), recall a single fact (a Lore roll), or perform a single physical action. Physical actions must take no longer than one minute (ten combat rounds). The bonus is equal to half the magus&rsquo;s Enigmatic Wisdom score.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus must have a score of at least one in the required Ability before it can be assisted by labyrinth meditations. Meditations add grace to the magus&rsquo;s thoughts and actions, but do not grant conscious skill. A magus who does not know how to swim, for example, cannot use the clarity of thought and action provided by the meditation to swim.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">Characters with an Enigmatic Wisdom score of three or more don&rsquo;t need a physical labyrinth; they can walk in a circle for the same effect.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

This is usually an animal&nbsp;or bird, but it can be a plant. The heartbeast is&nbsp;always a living thing, and usually a noble creature.&nbsp;No known magus has had an earthworm&nbsp;heartbeast, for example. A maga&rsquo;s heartbeast displays a central aspect of her nature, so that her personality, even in human form, will&nbsp;resemble that of the creature. Initiates of the&nbsp;Bjornaer mystery gain the Ability Heartbeast.&nbsp;This Ability cannot be gained by any character&nbsp;who has not been initiated into the mystery. For initiates of the Outer Mystery, the&nbsp;Heartbeast Ability is only used when something&nbsp;tries to stop the magus changing forms.&nbsp;In that case, a roll of Stamina + Heartbeast&nbsp;against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide&nbsp;allows the character to change anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Bjornaer maga can only change into&nbsp;one kind of animal, and that kind cannot be&nbsp;altered by Hermetic magic. The transformed Bjornaer can be changed, by Muto Animal magic, for example, but the kind of animal that&nbsp;her heartbeast is cannot be changed. A Bjornaer maga really is her heartbeast, and so remaining in that form does not count as being&nbsp;under an active mystical effect (see &ldquo;Warping,&ldquo;&nbsp;page 167). Of course, she is really human as&nbsp;well, so remaining human does not cause warping&nbsp;either. Hermetic magic is unable to tell whether an animal is actually a Bjornaer, and&nbsp;the same applies to most other kinds of magic.&nbsp;(This assumes that the maga is trying to hide&nbsp;her nature, of course.) As a result, a Bjornaer in&nbsp;animal form is affected by Animal spells, not&nbsp;Corpus or Mentem spells. Spells already in&nbsp;effect before the transformation remain in&nbsp;effect, however.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi can cast spells while in the&nbsp;form of their heartbeast, but they cannot speak&nbsp;or make the appropriate gestures, and thus normally&nbsp;take a &ndash;15 penalty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The transformation takes only a moment,&nbsp;and affects only the maga. None of her possessions are transformed. A Bjornaer who has been&nbsp;physically changed by magic may try to assume&nbsp;her normal form or her heartbeast form. She&nbsp;must roll Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease&nbsp;Factor set by the storyguide. As a rule of&nbsp;thumb, 3 + the magnitude of the transforming magic is a reasonable number. If she does&nbsp;resume one of her natural forms, the other&nbsp;magic is dispelled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi do not treat physical transformations&nbsp;as major magical effects for the purposes&nbsp;of gaining Warping Points. However, a&nbsp;magical transformation which is maintained&nbsp;over time will grant one Warping Point per&nbsp;year, as it is still a continuing mystical effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, Bjornaer magi cannot bind familiars.&nbsp;The reasons for this are debated, but the&nbsp;fact is uncontroversial.</p>","source":"ArM5","page":0,"defaultChaAb":"int","speciality":"changing into a wolf","xp":15,"key":"heartbeast","option":"","realm":"magic","indexKey":"heartbeast","reviewer":"xzotl","review_status":"reviewed","optionLinked":false,"accelerated":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null},"folder":"Ku86xoVh78FXIgLr","_id":"Kje4StUf0azqjqm4","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"1JBSgWiiwizu7vru":3,"wUH1ww0o0zQEBtKr":3}},{"name":"Guile","type":"ability","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/abilities/guile.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_buj82p3vtnu","path":"Abilities#/CF_SEP/General","color":"#000000"}},"system":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telling convincing lies, as well as feigning emotion, belief, or frame of mind.

The character must make a Stress Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to avoid suffering terrors. The storyguide may call for modifiers of –1 to –3 if he has faced eerie or terrifying events recently, like meeting a demon or battling the undead.&nbsp;</p><p>Suffering from terrors means that the character wakes up often and in a panic during the night. Situations might occur where he overreacts or reacts in unfortunate ways, if forced awake during such nights. The morning leaves him with a Long Term Fatigue Level lost. These Long Term Fatigue Levels are cumulative, so several bad nights leave him in bad shape.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>.

It is possible for unGifted characters to Initiate new Supernatural Abilities through a Mystery Cult, but even this is harder for them than for the Gifted.</p><p>Characters who have The Gift may start play with a single Supernatural Ability, without having to take any other Virtue, but if they wish to learn others they must find opportunities to do so in the course of the saga. They may also take Virtues granting Supernatural Abilities if they wish to have more Abilities at character creation. Note that it is harder for a character with Supernatural Abilities to become a Hermetic magus (see Training Your Apprentice on page @@), so you may not wish to take any such abilities if you plan for the character to become an apprentice. The ability to cast Hermetic magic is the single supernatural ability possessed by Hermetic magi in virtue of The Gift again, they may take more Supernatural Ability Virtues if they wish.</p><p>Grogs can never have The Gift, as a character with The Gift is too important to be a grog. As a rule, companions should only have The Gift if they are intended to become magi, or if they are members of one of the other magical traditions described in <strong>Ars Magica 5</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Edition</strong> supplements. Troupes should not allow any other Gifted characters unless they are absolutely sure that they want them.</p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":43,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"free"},"indexKey":"the-gift","review_status":"definitiveReady","reviewer":"Xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null},"folder":"umvpyTZt5f5tEdND","_id":"mgcCLWDH3sJ65Veq","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3,"wUH1ww0o0zQEBtKr":3}},{"name":"Affinity with Terram","type":"virtue","img":"systems/arm5e/assets/icons/VF/hermetic.svg","effects":[{"_id":"ux2586kvOboH4yBh","changes":[{"key":"system.arts.forms.te.xpCoeff","mode":1,"value":"1.5","priority":null}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"combat":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null},"origin":"Compendium.arm5e.virtues.HYsMf6f4axdDNHjD","tint":"#000000","transfer":true,"flags":{"arm5e":{"type":["affinity"],"subtype":["te"],"option":[null]}},"name":"Affinity with Terram","description":"","statuses":[],"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.11","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null},"img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","type":"base","system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"core":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_nxctmjlqqdb","path":"Virtues#/CF_SEP/Hermetic","color":"#000000"}},"system":{"description":"<p>Your Advancement Totals for one Hermetic Art are increased by one half, rounded up.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his <em>logica vetus </em>and <em>logica nova</em>. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his <em>De Inventione</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, <em>De arithmetica</em>. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his <em>Elementa</em>. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's <em>Optica</em> is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the <em>Libri Almagesti</em>. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in <em>De Musica</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Specialties:</strong> grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

Characters may take Virtues that grant Supernatural Abilities without taking The Gift, and such characters do not suffer the penalties imposed by The Gift. However, such characters may not learn new Supernatural Abilities in the course of the saga, although they may improve the ones they already have. It is possible for unGifted characters to Initiate new Supernatural Abilities through a Mystery Cult, but even this is harder for them than for the Gifted.</p><p>Characters who have The Gift may start play with a single Supernatural Ability, without having to take any other Virtue, but if they wish to learn others they must find opportunities to do so in the course of the saga. They may also take Virtues granting Supernatural Abilities if they wish to have more Abilities at character creation. Note that it is harder for a character with Supernatural Abilities to become a Hermetic magus (see Training Your Apprentice on page @@), so you may not wish to take any such abilities if you plan for the character to become an apprentice. The ability to cast Hermetic magic is the single supernatural ability possessed by Hermetic magi in virtue of The Gift again, they may take more Supernatural Ability Virtues if they wish.</p><p>Grogs can never have The Gift, as a character with The Gift is too important to be a grog. As a rule, companions should only have The Gift if they are intended to become magi, or if they are members of one of the other magical traditions described in <strong>Ars Magica 5</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Edition</strong> supplements.
